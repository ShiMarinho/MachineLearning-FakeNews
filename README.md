We live in an age where fake news is rife across social media platforms,
certain news outlets and streaming sites. We are bombarded with news every
second of every day. But how do we know if the news feed we are reading is
from a reliable source? This is in effect our objective with this project – to
acknowledge that news – fake or otherwise – is not transparent and to
explore ways in which online content can be filtered more thoroughly.
In short, we are filtering out the fake.
