It’s the first time since the trade war heated up in the middle of 2018 that withdrawals have hit non-U.S. oriented funds in consecutive months. Investors’ U.S. shift has occurred in the midst of a torrid 16 percent advance for the S&P 500 Index this year that has put it within spitting distance of its all-time high and outshined returns in emerging markets, developed markets and global equity benchmarks. Investors put $4.7 billion to work in U.S. equity funds during February and March while taking out nearly $7 billion from internationally-geared opportunities, according to Colas, who cites data from the Investment Company Institute.This marks a stark reversal of the prevailing trend since 2017, which has seen money move to international equity funds at the expense of domestic counterparts. The thinking in recent years had been that the U.S.’s decade-long bull-market run had gone on for so long and reached such heights that it was inevitable that global markets were poised to play catchup.That’s no longer the prevailing theory. Bank of America’s March survey of fund managers showed growing pessimism on the global economy. Shorting European equities was judged to be the most crowded trade in markets in the survey, which found two-thirds of respondents expect below-trend growth and inflation globally over the next year.The shift back to U.S. equities is based on the simple fact that they continue to outperform global alternatives, notes Colas. But on a deeper level, he adds, it could be fostered by deglobalization, a lack of faith in Europe or Japan’s ability to reflate their economies via monetary stimulus, and the elevated weighting of technology stocks in U.S. indexes compared with other bourses.Lawrence Hamtil, a financial adviser at Fortune Financial Advisors, takes a longer view. Since 1986, American outperformance in equities has been the rule, not the exception, he says.",0

Bob Fosse (Sam Rockwell), a director, and his wife Gwen Verdon (Michelle Williams), a dancer, helped to create hits such as “Damn Yankees!”, “Chicago” and “Cabaret"". There is plenty of exquisite choreography, as legs kick in perfect time and dazzling costumes shimmer on twisting bodies, plus a sparkling rendition of “Big Spender”. Elsewhere, in a fantasy scene, Fosse twirls effortlessly down a corridor, surrounded by colourful dancers. But the show turns out to be a surprisingly moving examination of the characters of Fosse and Verdon, as well as their extraordinary careers. It opens with the build-up to “Cabaret”, Fosse’s best-known film, which he directed and choreographed in 1971. The viewer is transported from Hollywood to damp, dark Munich, where it was shot, and the pressure is palpable. The film cannot afford to be “another $20m fiasco”, a producer warns, referring to one of Fosse’s previous misses. Fosse, in turn, takes it out on his crew. “I wanna see every muscle, every tendon,” he barks during exhausting rehearsals for “Mein Herr”, one of the nightclub songs. After seeing the first cut, he moans to his assistant that “it’s unwatchable”. On the night of the premiere, he paces in the auditorium rather than watching the film (it was a box-office triumph and would go on to win eight Oscars). His personal torment, and abject terror of failure, is clear.",0

In fact, one of the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). The word “vain” means “for no reason” or “useless.” “Thus, God was instructing the Israelites to avoid using his name in a useless, disrespectful way. Instead, the Israelites were supposed to revere the name of God and use it in a serious, considerate way. Many of the ancient Israelites were so respectful of the name of God that they would not even pronounce it or write it for fear of using it in vain. Those who did write it would often throw away the quill they had used, because they thought that any quill that had written God’s name was holy and should not be used for regular words. “Dr. John Hagee, the founder and senior pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, not only agrees with what the Good Book says, but also takes the faith to a level of fanaticism. Speaking exclusively with Newslo, Hagee stated that “in this world of crimes and deaths that surround us, a simple blasphemy does not get that much attention when it should.” “Saying the Lord’s name in vain might seem petite and insignificant compared to some of the things that are going on in the world right now, even in churches all across America,” Hagee elaborated. “But, that’s precisely the problem. If the shepherds of a faith start doing wrong, what is the flock supposed to do? Follow in their footsteps? I don’t think so. The flock needs to get its bearings and start thinking for itself.” The pastor reprimanded: “But, nowadays you have people committing sin everywhere you look, including Houses of God, which are the holiest of places.” Asked how the situation could be bettered, Hagee replied: “Well, we’d have to start with ourselves, as with everything in life. If you’re asking about my personal opinion, there is no greater sin in terms of wrongly using God’s name than women who use it during sex. That is one of the filthiest, most derogatory and sinful uses of the Lord’s name I can think of. If it were up to me, I would put every single woman or girl who does that in jail. That would be a fine example of God’s wrath aimed at what is, in my opinion, a terrible misuse of our Maker’s good name.”/religionlo.com/",1

Ms Nielsen stepped down on April 10th, but she had been twisting in the wind for months. Though she had publicly defended Mr Trump’s immigration policies, the president thought her weak. Her departure seems to presage a harsher turn on immigration from a president who considers the issue central to his re-election strategy.Few on the left will sympathise with Ms Nielsen. She was one of the faces of the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy, under which anyone who crossed America’s border illegally was referred to the Justice Department for prosecution. That resulted in the separation of thousands of children from their parents. Identifying all the families thus sundered, said the government in a court document filed last week, could take up to two years. She also defended two policies halted, to Mr Trump’s fury, by federal courts: one that would have prevented anyone who crossed the border illegally from claiming asylum, and another that would force asylum seekers to wait in Mexico rather than America while their claims were evaluated.",0

The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges.  Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil. This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government. The new “red flag” law, which has taken hold in other states already, allows the courts and law enforcement to take away guns from individuals they deem are dangerous and they’ve just begun the confiscation. A man living in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle, Washington became the first individual in the state to have his firearm confiscated without any formal arrest or charges.  The man was not identified by authorities. Neighbors complained that the man had been “staring” at people through storefront windows while wearing a holstered firearm. He was not brandishing his weapon by any account, and open carrying is legal in the area, so he was abiding by the law. Other residents also complained that the man’s open carrying made them feel “uncomfortable” and “unsafe.” “He was roaming the hallways with a .25 caliber automatic,” said Tony Montana, a man who lives in the same apartment complex as the gun owner and a person without any reasonable gun knowledge.

Rep. Swalwell even goes a step further, insisting that those who refuse to hand over their “assault” weapons be criminally prosecuted – including law-abiding gun owners who have never been convicted of committing a crime with their legally-purchased weaponry. Not content to simply impose a fresh ban on all new “assault” weapon purchases, which in and of itself is unconstitutional, Rep. Swalwell actually wants to see door-to-door gun confiscation teams engage in Nazi-style removal tactics in order to rid the streets of all firearms that he personally deems reckless and unnecessary. “Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed,” Rep. Swalwell wrote in his op-ed for USA Today. “This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come.” “Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons.",1

The article said that the quotes by Bullock came from her press conference for her ""new film,"" Our Brand Is Crisis. One big hint that this is fake news: that movie was released in 2015. In the movie, Bullock played a political consultant drafted to help the president of Bolivia win re-election as she competed with her rival working for another candidate. At a press conference in October 2015 for her movie, Bullock said she disagreed with Trump when asked about his comments about Mexican-Americans. ""I don’t agree with that at all,"" Bullock said. ""That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.""

Larry and Bob, two guys working inside the task force, spent more than three months tracking down artifacts being sold at exclusive auction houses and online black market dealers. According to Larry: “We found a trail of illegal sales of White House trinkets starting in about April of 2017. In the past two years, we linked those items to reports of missing historical pieces reported by White House staff during the Obama administration. All of the pieces are small enough to be smuggled out.” This bedpan was placed under Abraham Lincoln to catch him crapping himself as he died. It sold for $2.6 million. That means that even at a young age, Malia Obama was plotting future crimes; hoarding stolen goods for sale down the road.

She was mentored at that age by Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State when the girl was just 11-years-old. Hillary molded her into a criminal by teaching her to abandon her morals in favor of what’s good for ‘the people.’ She’s been a trained Clinton Foundation operative since she turned 16, and was activated the day she left home to go to Harvard.” Nancy Reagan’s Yoga Pants originally fetched nearly $200K but were returned after someone “much bigger than Nancy” stretched them out.

Photograph: Say No to the Pylons Residents’ groups in one of the most beautiful and rugged corners of Spain are protesting against plans to build a towering “electricity highway” over their hills, fields and farms, saying it will wreck their way of life.Activists in the Alpujarra and Lecrín valley areas of south-eastern Andalucía said the proposed 110-mile line between the provinces of Almería and Granada would have evastating consequences for a region that depends heavily on rural tourism and small-scale agriculture.The project, part of a national strategy to improve Spain’s energy infrastructure, is being overseen by the regional government of Andalucía.The energy firm Red Eléctrica de España, which is due to build the 220-kilovolt line, said the scheme would help give the area “a modern, secure and reliable electrical network”, as well as bringing €106m of investment and creating more than 700 jobs during the construction phase.It also said the project would not “substantially alter” the land on which it would sit.But many locals are bitterly opposed to the line, arguing that the company’s pylons, some of which stand 79 metres (260ft) tall, would ruin livelihoods and damage flora and fauna.“It would basically destroy the countryside and the way of life of a lot of people here,” said José Manuel Milán, a craftsman and gardener who is part of the Say No to the Pylons group in the Alpujarra. “This is an area that relies on nature tourism – there’s a lot of rural hotels, country cottages and restaurants. They would all suffer if the countryside was destroyed. People who come here for nature tourism aren’t going to want to spend their time here walking under cables.”Another member of the anti-pylon platform said the scheme would destroy the very thing that has allowed Alpujarra to recover from decades of depopulation.“This is a region that has managed to revive itself because of its natural beauty, which has brought in quite a lot of new inhabitants from both other parts of Spain and other EU countries,” said Jordi Jutglar, a baker originally from Catalonia. “I’ve spoken to people who were thinking about coming to live here but are now thinking twice about it because of the towers. No one wants to live in these conditions. It would be just devastating.”A consultation period on the project ended on Thursday, and Red Eléctrica said it would spend the coming months studying residents’ concerns.The Andalucían government will then decide whether the project should go ahead.Red Eléctrica said: “In general terms, the line won’t substantially alter the landscape as we’ve already tried to ensure that the route and pylons can be built so as to have the least damaging form.“But in any case, [we] will study all the objections and comments from neighbours and community groups and weigh up the viability of making changes to the project on environmental and sustainability grounds.”Among those who have lived in the area for decades are the writer Chris Stewart – who has chronicled life there in a series of books beginning with Driving over Lemons – and the record producer and Killing Joke bassist Youth.Stewart calls the Alpujarra, much of which lies within the Sierra Nevada national park, one of Europe’s “natural jewels”.",0

By 12:00 noon on September 10, computer models show that the strength and path of IRMA risk totally obliterating New York. Halturnerradioshow.com reports: The National Weather Service, and its National Hurricane Center utilize supercomputers to predict where hurricanes will travel based on hundreds-of-thousands of pieces of weather data. The system they use is called Global Forecast System (GFS). At 2:00 this afternoon, Friday, September 1, the GFS model spit out its projection of Hurricane IRMA’s path over the next 12 days. This model shows the utterly terrifying projected path of Hurricane IRMA coming right up the east coast, and making landfall in NEW YORK HARBOR as a Category 5 Hurricane, with winds in excess of 157 MPH. I am not a weather expert. I do not profess to have any idea at all about the accuracy of these computer models. As a layman, I know the models can turn out to be wrong. Sometimes even WAAAAAAAAAYYYY wrong. But if this model is right, then we in New Jersey (where I live) and folks in New York City, had better start preparing to EVACUATE within the next 7-8 days. I do not know of __ANY__ building that can withstand winds “in excess of 157 MPH.” I doubt my condo complex could withstand it. I cannot even imagine what the skyscrapers in New York City would do under such a wind load. I suspect some of them — MANY of them — might just snap and fall over. Even buildings which don’t simply blow over, would probably see ALL their windows blown out. Can you imagine getting hit by shattered glass driven by 157 MPH wind? It would cut a person to ribbons instantly! In all of recorded history, no storm like this has __EVER__ hit New Jersey or New York City. It would be beyond “catastrophic.” Seems to me, there would be NOTHING left! I emphasize that I know computer “models” are just that: MODELS. They may be very wrong. But given the specificity of this particular forecast, I feel it necessary to tell everyone in New Jersey and New York City to absolutely watch this storm every day.

For now, though, “we are focused on growing the business.”He and Igor Bukhman, 37, are the brains behind Playrix Holding Ltd., the creator of popular games similar to Candy Crush, including Fishdom and Gardenscapes, with more than 30 million daily users from China to the U.S. and annual sales of $1.2 billion, according to Newzoo. That makes the company one of the top 10 iOS and Google Play app developers by revenue, data from researcher AppAnnie show, putting Playrix in the same league as Tencent Holdings Ltd., NetEase Inc. and Activision Blizzard Inc.Today, each brother is worth about $1.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. They haven’t previously appeared in a global wealth ranking.Their road to riches started in 2001 in the city of Vologda, almost 300 miles (483 kilometers) north of Moscow, where Igor learned from a university professor that he could sell software online. He decided to try with Dmitry, who was still in high school at the time.“We had no experience, no business understanding whatsoever—everything we could imagine was writing games,” Igor said.The U.S. is Playrix’s biggest market, followed by China and Japan, the brothers said in a recent interview in Tel Aviv, where they spend some of their time. The two remotely manage about 1,100 employees, including personnel at its Ireland headquarters and developers in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.The brothers’ first product was a game akin to Xonix in which players must use a cursor to open pieces of a hidden picture before being struck by flying balls. They wrote it during a summer break and generated $60 in the first month and later $100 a month, about half of the average salary in Vologda.“We thought, ‘If one game makes $100, we can write several dozen of them and make a lot of money,”’ Igor said.Their second game, featuring an animated character designed by an outsourced artist, brought in $200 a month. Their copycat of Tetris brought in $700 a month, but the brothers shut that down after learning that the game was protected by a license. In 2004, when the business reached $10,000 of monthly revenue, they registered a legal entity, rented space for an office in the basement of a book warehouse and hired other staff to accelerate production.In the early years, they sold casual games through sites such as majorgeeks.com or download.com, before moving to bigger platforms like Yahoo! and AOL. Then, within the past decade, games started moving first to Facebook and then smartphones. Many of them were available for free, with users paying only for certain in-game features.Playrix makes most of its money from in-app purchases and the brothers mostly shun advertising, which detracts from the user experience. Ads generate less than 3 percent of revenue, Dmitry said.",0

The remains of a woman were found in a dumpster at Huma Abedin’s New York apartment. Hillary Clinton is silent on the topic as Huma’s neighbors told the cops they believe the police investigation has something to do with Anthony Weiner’s recent conviction. On Tuesday evening, a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a New York apartment block where Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin own a home. The 48-year-old, who police say lived at the premises, was found unconscious inside the machine and was pronounced dead at the scene. Her cause of death has yet to be announced by the medical examiner. Police had been called to the block at 1 Irving Place in Union Square just before 5pm. The deceased woman, whose identity has been withheld until police notify her family, was found by a building maintenance worker. Police do not yet know how she ended up in the trash compactor, but neighbors at the luxury apartment block told NBC they believed the police presence was related to Weiner’s recent conviction for sexting an underage girl: Police say a woman was found dead inside a trash compactor at a luxury residential building in Manhattan’s Union Square. Crime scene investigators were on the scene at 1 Irving Place Tuesday evening, collecting evidence in the bizarre and grisly death. Police say it’s not clear yet how the 48-year-old woman died, but her body was found at around 5 p.m. Her purse was found near the trash chute where it appears she went in. Neighbors said they initially thought the police presence had something to do with the building’s famous resident, Anthony Weiner. The disgraced former congressman is still listed as a resident at the building, though he’s currently serving time in prison for sexting an underage girl. Security footage also shows the woman walking into the apartment building shortly before she was found inside the machine, PIX11 reported: A woman’s body was found inside of a trash compactor near Union Square on Tuesday, police said. Officers found the body at the Zeckendorf Towers on Irving Place just before 5 p.m., officials said. The woman, identified only as being 48 years old, was unconscious and unresponsive when police arrived on scene. Security camera shows the woman entering the building shortly before her body was found in the trash compactor, sources said. Property belonging to the woman, who entered the compactor area on the 27th floor, was found inside the compact room, police sources said. Police have not yet released her name. The circumstances around her death are not yet clear. According to Daily Mail, Weiner and Abedin have owned an apartment at the address for 16 years, which was listed for rent at $11,900 a month on the same day he pleaded guilty to sexting a 15-year-old girl. Abedin also filed for divorce that same day. The listing, posted on May 19, 2017, was taken down just days later, though it is unclear as to whether the estranged couple found a renter, or if the property was taken off the market for other reasons. It certainly will be interesting to see what they come up with in order to explain away what appears to be a murder at the apartment building where Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner own a home. Will they call it a robbery, like in the case of Seth Rich? Perhaps the better question is this: What did this woman know about Hillary Clinton?",1

He reckoned that new ideas were a “humiliation” and an “affront” not only to people’s sensibilities but to their convictions, too. Like the ancient Greeks, Miller thought of drama as a “civic art”, a discipline that could contribute towards a state’s social and political progress. Unlike his contemporaries, he was not commercially minded. He said what no one else had the courage to, and his audiences would weep, or sit with their heads bowed. Irate patriots picketed theatres, and producers shied away from his work. Actors who appeared in his plays were shunned by their friends.Miller’s observations hold true in the 21st century, particularly about the fallacy of the American Dream. Many still think of material wealth and status as essential to happiness, as Willy Loman does in “Death of a Salesman”. “The American Clock”, which reflects on the Wall Street Crash and the Great Depression, is a reminder of the perils of short-termism. “The Price”, set 30 years later, focuses on the longer-term repercussions. In “All My Sons” Miller questions individualist thinking. “The Crucible” examines the destructive allure of ideologies.",0

This was the feeling of living in history, of witnessing the unfolding of an event that will reverberate for years to come. Soon there will be polemics about how the fire started, about why the French state had only pledged 2 million euros, or $2.3 million, a year for the upkeep of Notre-Dame, which in 2017 started raising 150 million euros in private funding for a sorely needed renovation. Already there are debates about the destruction of other monuments in other contexts, such as the Roman temples in Palmyra, Syria, and who will pledge the funds to rebuild those.Then, after the living-in-history feeling, a different one came. This was the falling feeling that sets in when something you believed was unchangeable changes, when something you believed was indestructible is destroyed. The order of things shifts. Monuments are supposed to precede us and outlive us. We measure ourselves and the span of our lives against them. We aren’t supposed to watch them burn before our eyes. Ours is a certain kind of grief, both personal and collective. Tout passe, tout casse, tout lasse, as the French proverb goes. Everything passes, everything breaks, everything leaves.And then there are the multiple dimensions of the loss. The devastation of the basilica is material—what caused the fire? What will the repairs look like? It is also symbolic. Commentators were seeing the fire as a symbol, of how the Catholic Church needs to be restored as an institution as much as a building. Like so many of Europe’s great churches and places of pilgrimage, Notre-Dame is dedicated to the Virgin Mary. This is the Church as mother and protector, an aspect the institution has not excelled at in the years since the sexual-abuse crisis erupted.",0

Producers initially promised large, exciting battles and decisive story lines but thus far have had issues delivering consistently. Fans of the show place the blame for many of those issues on producers insisting the show split air time with spinoff drama Iraq.Despite the small TV audience tuning in, a large number of Americans (about 14,000 at present) physically attend the conflict every year hoping to take part in events as they unfold.However, many of these participants express discontent over the direction the show has taken and feel the program has been dragging for the last decade or so.“I was skeptical at first because there had been a Russian drama about Afghanistan, but in the first few seasons, this felt very different.

The same vaccines that have already caused mass sterilization and death on multiple continents. The second-richest man on the planet is a committed globalist and eugenicist working towards the New World Order goal of depopulation. Lest anyone forget these facts, Bill Gates regularly goes out of his way to remind us of them. Bill Gates and his foundation have consistently come under fire for their goal of depopulation, and now the same man who admitted in a TED talk that his goal is to eliminate a billion humans from the face of the earth has now taken to Facebook to lecture us about why being eradicated is in our own interests. The irony of Bill Gates’ faux concern for the human race is almost laughable. India, however, may not find it so funny. Last year, India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization announced that it would be banning the Gates Foundation from operating in the country after it was revealed that the vaccines the foundation had been promoting “to make people healthier” were actually doing irreparable harm to young girls — and that the Gates Foundation “campaigns” were actually “experimental trials of the vaccines.” Mainstream investigators have found that these vaccine trials in India led to thousands of injuries and deaths of young women. The “philanthropist” has also funded secretive sterilization programs, and says we should form death panels to differentiate between those who are worthy of life and those who “have no benefit whatsoever” to society. This cold,  skewed psychopathic “logic” is terrifying and brings to mind the worst excesses of the 20th century’s most evil regimes. Now we are starting to see the horrific results of Gates’ depopulation agenda playing out around the world. Kenya doesn’t find his Gates’ fake concern for the human race amusing either. In September of 2017 it was reported that at least 500,000 young Kenyan girls and women have been made sterile, following a tetanus vaccine administered by the government, and pushed by the international organizations in Bill Gates’ back pocket: “Today, we can confirm to the country that the Catholic Church was right. Hundreds of thousands of our girls and women, aged between 14 and 49, from the fastest growing populations in the country will not have children, because of the state-sponsored sterilization that was sold to the country as tetanus vaccination,” Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga declared. Gates, who has $23m of shares in Monsanto, is responsible for widespread vaccination programs which have been linked to outbreaks of disease in South America and the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. GMOs and vaccinations have both been linked to human illness and death, even though Big Pharma and Big Ag continue to deny the undeniable correlations. Let’s ask ourselves this: If Gates is focused on his goal of reducing the number of people on our planet, why would he then fund vaccination programs to save lives? None of this makes any sense, unless the vaccinations are not meant to save lives at all.",1

When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened. The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death. The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it. Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said.

Violators will have to pay a fine of $1,000 per day during normal seasons and $10,000 per day if “the violation occurs in a critically dry year immediately preceded by two or more consecutive below normal, dry, or critically dry years,” the law states. According to the attentive folks at The Organic Prepper, this allotted water ration exceeds the amount required for taking a shower and doing a single load of laundry and excludes taking baths altogether. Writer Daisy Luther notes that an ordinary load of laundry uses about 40 gallons of water, while an eight-minute shower uses some 17 gallons of water. A bathtub holds 80 to 100 gallons of water. This means combining a shower and laundry on the same day would use 57 gallons of water, two gallons above the limit. According to the new law, the 55-gallon per person limit will be reduced even further in future years, dropping to 52.5 gallons per capita in 2025 and just 50 gallons per person in 2030. To ensure compliance, the government of California urges the use of creative surveillance systems to spy on all residents. Utility providers will be obligated to report on violators, and urban retail water suppliers “shall use satellite imagery, site visits, or other best available technology to develop an accurate estimate of landscaped areas.” So as not to overburden the wealthy, there will be “provisions for swimming pools, spas, and other water features,” the law states. … The new, more aggressive mandatory water use levels set by the State Water Resources Control Board in coordination with the Department of Water Resources establish the initial indoor water allowance of 55 gallons per person per day and will also set an outdoor residential amount as well as a standard for system wide pipe leak losses. This new law is ridiculous and will turn most honest, law abiding residents of California into lawbreakers. Even worse, the drought has technically ended in California, so these restrictions make no sense based on current conditions. If the politicians who run the state really wanted to solve the problem they would have limited the amount of grass homeowners can plant, and ban swimming pools.

That John Ashe was a former President of the United Nations General Assembly highlights the fact that no one is safe once in their sights. And as you might have guessed, there are major inconsistencies with Ashe’s death. It was not only conveniently timed because Ashe died just a few days before being set to testify against Clinton in a corruption case, but official reports indicated he died of a heart attack.The problem, however, is that police on the scene reported Ashe died when his throat was crushed during a work-out accident. The New York Post’s Page Six reported that after Ashe was found dead Wednesday, the U.N. claimed that he had died from a heart attack. Local police officers in Dobbs Ferry, New York, later disputed that claim, saying instead that he died from a workout accident that crushed his throat.  Adding to the mysterious nature of Ashe’s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over $1 billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly. And then there was this: During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Seng illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the Democrat National Committee. It must be coincidence, right? If former Secret Service agent Gary Byrne is to be believed, this is business as usual for the Clintons. BYRNE: I feel so strongly that people need to know the real Hillary Clinton and how dangerous she is in her behavior. She is not a leader. She is not a leader.  SEAN: She does not have the temperament? BYRNE: She doesn’t have the temperament. She didn’t have the temperament to handle the social office when she was First Lady, she does not have the temperament. SEAN: She’s dishonest. BYRNE: She’s dishonest, she habitually lies, anybody that can separate themselves from their politics and review her behavior over the past 15 years… Byrne is the author of the newly published book Crisis Of Character – a first-hand Clinton exposé.",1

Scott Baio, 56, was killed when the single-engine Cessna he was in crashed into the side of a hill in Louisiana. Baio was headed to Mar-A-Lago to barbecue shrimp and play gold with President Trump. Baio’s wife, Raylene, wasn’t on the plane but was checked into St Timothy’s on a suicide watch after the news sent her into a breakdown. Spokesmen for several actors who wouldn’t be caught dead in a film with Baio said that he was “really special as Chachi” and he “sure did do a nice job with Charles in Charge.” Baio, wildly successful as an actor since the ripe age of 13, says he saved every dime he ever made so he could live the lavish lifestyle of jetting across the country to golf with famous and powerful people. Unfortunately, that ended with a net worth of about $3.5 million and a whole lot of that was tied up in that nice house of his, so Baio was forced to go Cessna instead, which only would have gotten him there slightly faster than that new Kia Sorento he’s been sporting. Baio will be missed by many. His ability to retweet things in support of our glorious president without even bothering to care what they were truly drove the social media movement to get Trump elected. When he heard the news that Baio was killed, Trump asked for a moment of silence in the dining room during his morning coffee and strudel. He hasn’t personally responded but Jeff Derpinger of the WHOIP told Freedom Crossroads correspondent Louis Leweigh: “The President was saddened by the news once we reminded him that Scott was once ‘Chachi.’ He said he wished he knew the kid was coming; he would have sent the jet.” To clear it up, libtards, he would probably send the company jet and not Air Force One. Maybe one of the smaller planes like the Secretary of State gets but nothing bigger than that. Baio’s remains are scattered with the wreckage, with slammed nose first into a cliff face. The FCC said the pilot probably got disoriented in a cloud bank and came at a 30-degree downward angle directly into solid quartz with a touch of limestone. The plane fell nearly 1400 feet to the basin below where very little was recognizable.",1

Trump’s early decision to approve the pipeline was a conflict-of-interest, and we must impeach him for it. Donald Trump’s business investments spread throughout the world. Now, we know that he has ties to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the one that crosses sacred Indian land. The construction of the pipeline raised the ire of Native American Sioux settlements in the area. It will cross sacred land and pollute their water supply. The pipeline is also a threat to the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, which provide drinking water for millions of people. In addition, the two rivers provide shipping avenues for commerce through the middle of the country. Opposition to the pipeline resulted in massive protests. The protests received international coverage when police and security workers for the construction firms sprayed protestors with water and beat them. The opposition brought out many supporters, too. On November 15, 2016, there was a National Day of Action to protest the construction. There were massive protests in cities as Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, and Trump’s own Manhattan in support of the Sioux Nation. Veterans also went to the front lines of the protest to stand against the construction and the violence from the hired thugs. American heroes supporting Native American heroes. And now we learn that “President” Trump has investments in the companies building the pipelines. No wonder the Orange Fuehrer ordered the resumption of their construction as one of his first moves as president. This should come as no surprise since Trump �?s financial ties are everywhere. Almost daily, we hear of another financial conflict-of-interest involving the president. This involvement is another example of Trump’s unconstitutional failure to divest himself of his businesses interests. The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution prohibits him from profiting from decisions made while president. And here it is, another unconstitutional violation. According to Ethics experts, Trump’s decisions to pass his businesses to his two sons is not adequate. As with other presidents, he must divest himself of all business interests and place them in a blind trust. The blind trust would prohibit Trump from any involvement. As he wants it, his two spoiled brat sons would consult him on business decisions regularly, and he would surely lie about it. The Dakota Pipeline investment is one of many illegal ones by Trump, but perhaps the most controversial. If only the mainstream media will pick up the story and run with it will the public know of Trump’s support of the cruel actions of the police. We must insist that the media tell this story. With its broadcast, the public will see how Trump uses the presidency for his financial gain and support his immediate impeachment.",1

Just when you thought it couldn’t get darker or colder outside, the fear-mongering conspiracy theorists are here to tell you you’re wrong .. If you can suspend reality long enough to believe Jupiter and Venus will collide on Monday in an ‘astronomical’ space collision and subsequent global blackout, just because they said so in their falsified NASA statement. According to the identity stealing so-called experts, writing on the website Dinos Mark as well as Reflection of Mind, the two brightest planets in our solar system will crash into each other and could even be visible from the naked eye. Now, to fan the flames of this fabricated fire, some clever cloggs has even gone as far as to publish a false statement. The statement purported to be written by NASA official Charles Boden – who must be pretty angry right now – ‘confirmed’ the world would be plunged into darkness from November 15 and November 29. NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2017. The event, according to NASA, hasn’t occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the ‘November Black Out’ event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter. The internet hoax isn’t news, with many liars claiming darkness will descend in some New World Order extra-terrestrial scam. NASA has denied it will happen time and time again, stating in over one million years, an event like this has never occurred. The overactive imaginations of conspiracy theorists must be commended, but perhaps next time, put it into a work of science fiction rather than try and pass it off as a NASA-confirmed fact. Meanwhile, on the Internet, other theorists are gearing up for their psychic predictions for 2018, like Craig Hamilton-Parker, the self-proclaimed modern day Nostradamus. A self-proclaimed prophet, who wants to seemingly shatter your dreams, hopes and aspirations for next year with his special potion of unproven alarm and fear-mongering mysticism. Hamilton-Parker, who shares all his best work on YouTube and psychics.com from his home in Southampton, foresees a US attack on North Korea, a chemical attack on a European city and an attempt to impeach Trump. He doesn’t reveal his sources, but it seems he’s really keeping up with current affairs in his mission to pull predictions out of his backside. For 2018 he’s bookmarked in his calendar the following world crises: US forces striking North Korea by blowing up a key trade route, Kim Jong-un being overthrown by his own people, a failed attempt to impeach Donald Trump and the sinking of a US warship. The good news is there’s absolutely no proof this guy has any more insight into what’s going to happen to the global political and social climate in 2018, than he does into what I’m going to have for my dinner.

HOBBUS J.D.","COSTA MESA, Ca. – GOP presidential front-runner and billionaire entrepreneur Donald Trump on Thursday unveiled his plan to ‘make the military great again,’ saying he intends to reinstate the draft as part of a larger effort to bolster America’s armed forces. “We’re bringing back the draft, okay? We’re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,” Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa. “I love the Sixties,” said Trump, continuing, “I was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.” In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. “You have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We’re not going to give it to them, folks. They’re going to have to earn their citizenship.” Trump has repeatedly stated that he won’t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing “man-portable” tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. “We’re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we’re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.” Rather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option “extremely” liberally. “My feeling is we have these weapons and we’ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there’s absolutely no reason why we shouldn’t be using them.” The former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. “This guy’s the president of the United States and he’s bowing to the Chinese. They’re laughing in our faces, okay? They’re laughing in our faces and if we don’t do something about it, they’re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we’re going to have a huge problem on our hands.” Donald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County.

Future Now was inspired by Trump, but its goal isn’t—in and of itself—to defeat him. If anything, the organization’s entire raison d’être is to break the Democratic Party’s obsession with the presidency and redirect its focus back to the places where, Future Now’s founders argue, conservatives have amassed their most durable power: state legislatures.“I don’t think this is a crisis that was created by Donald Trump, and I don’t think it’s solved by beating him. I think that he is a reflection of a really broken politics,” one of the co-founders, former State Senator Daniel Squadron of New York, told me. “State legislatures are the most important part of American civic life that’s been forgotten, except by the worst elements of politics and vested special interests. We have decided to focus all of our energy on the least glamorous, often most frustrating part of politics.”Squadron is hardly the first Democrat to respond to the shock of Trump’s win by suddenly singing the gospel of the states. Indeed, so many state-focused national organizations sprang up in the aftermath of 2016 that a leader of one of them told me the bumper crop is “confusing to the donor community.” In addition to Future Now, there’s Flippable, Sister District, and Forward Majority—all dedicated in one fashion or another to winning state legislative chambers for Democrats. Most of the groups are making an aggressive play for statehouses in 2020 because it’s the last chance for Democrats to win the ability to control the post-census redistricting process in many states.",0

She had campaigned for the right to drive.A hearing in the trial of several prominent Saudi women’s rights activists has been postponed, despite intense scrutiny of the case from the kingdom’s western partners.The fourth hearing in the trial of 11 activists including Loujain al-Hathloul, Eman al-Nafjan and Aziza al-Yousef was cancelled at the last minute on Wednesday, a court official told some of the women’s relatives, according to Reuters. The official cited a judge who gave “private reasons” for the postponement and no new date for the hearing was set.Foreign media and diplomats – already barred from attending previous sessions in the high-profile trial – were turned away from Riyadh’s criminal court. A panel of three judges had been expected to examine the response already submitted by the detainees to the charges against them.It follows further arrests of the women’s family members and supporters this month, in a sign that Riyadh is not bending to international pressure over its treatment of political prisoners.The women on trial, all active campaigners in the fight to end the country’s guardianship system that renders women second-class citizens, were arrested last May, just before Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman lifted the longstanding ban on women driving. Among the charges they face are allegations of spying and harming Saudi interests by contacting foreign media, diplomats and human rights groups.Since their arrest the Guardian has seen leaked medical reports saying that several of the women are suffering from malnutrition, cuts, bruises and burns, evidence which appears to contradict the authorities’ insistence that men and women in their custody are not being tortured.Hathloul’s family have accused her interrogators of sexual abuse and torture during nearly a year in custody.The allegations have fuelled criticism of the kingdom’s human rights record, already under intense scrutiny after the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last year. While the royal family has acknowledged that a team of Saudi operatives killed the journalist inside the diplomatic mission in October, they have described the incident as a rogue operation carried out without the involvement of the crown prince.Khashoggi’s death is believed to have led King Salman to order a review of the decision to arrest and detain about 200 men and women in a crackdown ordered by his son and heir Prince Mohammed. The medical reports viewed by the Guardian were part of recommendations made by the investigation to pardon all the prisoners or at least allow an early release for those suffering from serious health problems.Three of the detained women – Yousef, Nafjan and the academic Dr Rokaya Mohareb – were released on bail last month. The case has also been transferred from a high-security terrorism court to a criminal court, steps taken after lobbying efforts from human rights groups and western governments.However, at least 14 more people believed to be supportive of the women, including academics and writers, were arrested earlier in April. Among the new detainees was Yousef’s son, Salah al-Haidar. Haidar and another new detainee are dual US citizens, and one detainee is pregnant.The Saudi government has so far not publicly commented on the latest crackdown and the new detainees’ whereabouts are unknown. Last Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said he had pressed Saudi Arabia, a close ally of Donald Trump’s administration, to release the US citizens.Prince Mohammed has ushered in sweeping social reforms in Saudi Arabia since he was appointed heir to the throne in 2017. Curbing the powers of the country’s notorious religious police and reintroducing cinemas and public entertainment has been accompanied by a sustained crackdown on intellectuals, businesspeople, clerics and rivals considered a threat to his power.",0

In May 2002, the US withdrew its acceptance of the Rome statute, under which the international criminal court had been created, threatening to release – by military force if necessary – any indicted US citizens who might come to be legitimately held at The Hague. In August 2002, the US threatened to withdraw aid from countries that refused to recognise the immunity of US military personnel from ICC prosecution. Even the US-based Human Rights Watch described this as “blackmail”.The US continues to withhold recognition of the ICC, which it openly demeans, revoking the visa of its chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, this month, merely for declaring the ICC’s intention to investigate US servicemen and CIA personnel for their possible roles in war crimes and other abuses.In a speech in Washington last September, the US national security adviser, John Bolton, described the court as “invalid” and “antithetical to our nation’s ideals”. He said the US would “… provide no assistance to the ICC … We will let the ICC die on its own … for all intents and purposes, the ICC is dead to us.”Such attitudes hardly support the idea of Julian Assange facing justice in the US.I was relieved to read Nesrine Malik’s contribution to the discussion of Julian Assange’s extradition and the difference between his whistleblowing on evidence of US war crimes and the arrest warrant issued by Sweden over allegations of sexual assault and rape (The left is still blinkered about Assange, 15 April).Like many on the left, I have been troubled by Labour prioritising the whistleblowing over the allegations of assault.

"54","http://politicot.com/spicer-trump-legal-right-cancel-scotus-serve-pleasure/","Alex Stevan","During a Monday press conference that media outlets were banned from airing, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced that the president was sending “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of an alleged terrorist attack in London and to the families of seven dead U.S. sailors. Spicer defended the ban on broadcasting the briefing by noting that President Donald Trump had already appeared on camera on Monday for several minutes, although he took no questions. Spicer also said that the president had confidence in all the members of the Justice Department, including Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is reportedly investigating the president for obstruction of justice. He also insisted that Trump has the power to fire Mueller if necessary. “If you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president,” he said. “That is a fact.” Asked by several reporters to clarify the full extent of the president’s power, or in other words, its limitations – if they exist – Spicer argued that the Constitution “clearly states” what the President of the United States can and cannot do. “However,” he added, “one must also recognize the fact that our Constitution was written quite a while ago and, as such, isn’t ideal when it comes to facing the issues that plague the American society nowadays. One of those issues is also the limit of the president’s power. Just like our language and many other things that are typically American, our Constitution is also a living thing that changes and evolves as time goes by. And if it doesn’t do so on its own, then it has us, the people of America, to help it. However, seeing how the people already have more than enough on their plate these days, the president has decided not to bother you folks with such boring decisions.” Spicer continued, “As a result, the president of the country nowadays has very different legal and executive abilities than those of many of his predecessors, especially some of the first ones like George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. As a matter of fact, in order to be able to deal with the problems of today, which vary incredibly compared to ones that existed when the Constitution was written, Donald Trump has incomparably more power than any other president in the history of our country. In other words, there’s a real need to follow the aforementioned ‘if you serve at the pleasure of the president, you serve at the pleasure of the president’ rule. For example, President Trump not only has the power to fire Robert Mueller; he also has the legal ability and right to cancel and disband the Supreme Court of the United States as well, should he feel the need for it. And no one could argue with such a decision.” “This is something that’s necessary in order to cope with the daily problems and disasters that go with the territory of living in a technologically advanced time. To make things perfectly clear once again: this is not something that’s exclusive to just Donald Trump; whoever succeeds him as president will also have a slightly higher level of power, because this power is linked to the position, not the man in the position. It is today a requirement as much as it is a logical order of events. It is important that we evolve with the times and not be stuck in the past while everyone else goes past us. We need to retain the proactively flexible approach to life that has been our trademark for so long. That goes especially for interpreting the Constitution of the United States,” Spicer concluded.",1

Trump’s recent attack on U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel because of his Mexican-American background prompted Sen. Lindsey Graham to round up the Republicans who have previously endorsed Donald Trump, and persuade them to take it all back. Graham claimed that Trump’s racist remarks were “the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy.” “If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,” Graham told The New York Times.” Senator Graham elaborated on this during an interview with NBC News’ Hallie Jackson. “There are a lot of people who want to be loyal to the Republican Party, including me,” he said. “But there’ll come a point in time where we’re gonna have to understand that it’s not just about the 2016 race, it’s about the future of the party and I would like to support our nominee. I just can’t.” Donald Trump claimed that Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the Trump University case, has been biased toward him because of his Latino heritage. “I couldn’t disagree more with a statement like that,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Sunday. “Those kinds of comments are very serious to me,” Rep. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said to News radio WGAN. “They are completely unacceptable, and what they indicate — which is why I think this is so serious — is a lack of respect for our judicial system and for the separation of powers doctrine that is enshrined in the Constitution.” Although many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have condemned Trump’s accusations, they continue to support him.",1

Have this many centenarians actually been voting in North Carolina, or is this a sign of voter fraud as some have asked? Neither, according to the State Board of Elections. The true explanation is much less exciting. Prior to passage of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) in 1993, the state did not require those registering to provide their birth date. While most voters who registered before NVRA did provide birth dates, some did not. These voters were automatically assigned a default birth date of 01/01/1900 in the state’s voter rolls. So while these voters are still diligently voting, it is very doubtful they are 112 years old.",1

"59","https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/04/16/rebuilding-the-cathedral-after-the-blaze","economist sources","EMMANUEL MACRON was unequivocal. Speaking after a fire destroyed the roof and spire of the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the French president vowed: “I solemnly say tonight: we will rebuild it together”. An international fund-raising drive has already received its first big pledges. François-Henri Pinault, boss of the Kering luxury-goods company, said he will donate €100m ($113m); the family of Bernard Arnault and his LVMH group, another luxury-goods firm, promised a further €200m.Exactly how much money will be needed will depend on exactly what the police and fire service find as they rummage through the wreckage. But early signs are encouraging. The efforts of the firemen prevented the blaze from reaching the cathedral’s two belfries. And while pictures of the blaze looked catastrophic, says Lisa Reilly, an architectural historian at the University of Virginia, Notre Dame’s Gothic architecture was designed partly to resist such accidents.Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.The heart of the cathedral is an enclosed stone vault, supported at the sides by buttresses and with a timber-framed roof built atop the ceiling. The idea, says Dr Reilly, is that if the roof catches fire—which was a serious risk in an age when lighting came from candles or oil lamps—it can burn away without compromising the structural integrity of the vault itself. That theory seems to have (mostly) held up. The main body of the cathedral is still standing. But early pictures show that at least one section of the vault has fallen in, scattering charred debris across the cathedral floor.Stone may be more resistant to fire than wood, but it is not immune to its effects. One critical question is just how hot the vault became. There was plenty of fuel at Notre Dame. The cathedral’s roof was held up by oak beams so densely packed that they were known as “the forest”.Under the right conditions wood fires can reach temperatures of 1,000°C or more. Temperatures much lower than that can be enough to cause damage. After a fire at Windsor Castle outside London in 1992, the Building Research Establishment, then a part of the British government, commissioned studies into the effects of fires on stone buildings. Notre Dame is built from limestone, which the BRE found became discoloured at the relatively low temperature of 250°C, thanks to chemical reactions in iron compounds within the stone. Higher temperatures caused more serious problems. In laboratory tests, limestone began to weaken at around 600°C. At 700°C its compressive strength had fallen by about 40%. Rapid cooling—thanks to being deluged with water from firehoses, for instance—weakened the stone still further.Stone is a poor conductor of heat, which means that the temperature on the side of a masonry block facing a fire can be far higher than on the side facing away. Such thermal stresses can cause big cracks. After a fire at York Minster cathedral in 1984 around 100 tons of cracked stonework needed replacing. Even the cooling process can cause problems. “The vault will have had burning timbers sitting on it for some hours,” says Robert Bowles, a British structural engineer who specialises in conserving old buildings. “As the masonry cools down and shrinks it may deform.” One of the priorities will be trying to determine just how sound the damaged portions of the vault’s ceiling remain.History, though, offers reasons to be cheerful. Notre Dame has been restored before, after vandalism during the French revolution and neglect until the 19th century, when the spire was rebuilt. Dr Reilly points to the cathedral at Reims, whose roof was similarly burnt away after it was hit by shelling in the first world war. Later attacks caused even more damage, leaving the building in a much worse state than Notre Dame. A restoration project, partly funded by the Rockefeller Foundation, saw Reims reopened in 1938.Today's restorers should have an easier time of it. Researchers led by the late Andrew Tallon, of Vassar College, in New York, conducted a detailed laser scan of the entire building. Their billion-plus data points constitute a virtual copy of the building, accurate to within five millimetres, that could prove vital in the reconstruction effort.A resurrection of Notre Dame, in other words, seems eminently possible. Another priority task, says Mr Bowles, will be to erect a temporary roof so the drying-out process can begin, and to protect the remaining masonry from the elements. Here, at least, the gods seem to be smiling: the weather forecast in Paris is for a week of bright sunshine.",0

Photograph: Nicolas Asfouri/AFP/Getty Images Russia could block access to Facebook and Twitter if the social media companies fail to fulfil its demand to move data on Russian users to servers located within the country, officials have warned.Alexander Zharov, the head of Roskomnadzor, Russia’s communications watchdog, said the western companies had nine months to bring their operations in line with Russian internet security laws. “They’ve been given time to comply,” he said.A law approved in 2014 by Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, requires domestic and foreign companies to store the personal data of Russian citizens on servers in Russia. Those who refuse can be fined or prevented from operating in the country. In 2016, Russia blocked LinkedIn, the professional networking website.Last week, Moscow ordered Facebook and Twitter to pay fines of 3,000 roubles (£36) over their refusal to obey the law, a move that was mocked by social media users. However, the fine was the minimum allowed under the law, and Zharov warned that the scale of punishments would steadily increase.Russia has threatened in the past to block the two sites for violations of the law, but this is the first time it has issued such a specific ultimatum.Both Twitter and Facebook have been widely used by the anti-Putin opposition to coordinate demonstrations and publish investigations into alleged high-level corruption. Critics fear storing the personal data of users in Russia would allow the Kremlin’s security services to access information on opposition activists.Facebook said in November that it had 6.2 million users in Russia, a number dwarfed by the 70 million Russians who use VKontakte, the country’s most popular social networking website.VKontakte’s founder, Pavel Durov, was forced to give up control of the company after backing street protests against Putin in 2011-12. It is now owned by the Mail.ru group, which belongs to the Kremlin-friendly billionaire Alisher Usmanov.Russia has also attempted, with limited success, to block Telegram, the messaging service set up by Durov in 2013. It continues to be widely used, including by senior Russian government officials who are reported to use VPNs (virtual private networks) to get around the ban. Officials last month threatened to block popular VPNs unless they agreed to restrict access to websites banned by Russia.Zharov’s comments came shortly after Russia’s parliament approved a bill that would allow Moscow to cut off the country’s internet traffic from foreign servers. Critics say the move would lead to greater censorship, while the authors of the bill say it is aimed at making Russia’s internet less vulnerable to cyberwarfare.",0

In the wake of the attack, the intelligence community mobilized with one overriding goal: preventing another 9/11. The CIA, the National Security Agency, and the 15 other components of the U.S. intelligence community restructured, reformed, and retooled. Congress appropriated billions of dollars to support the transformation.That effort paid off. In the nearly two decades that U.S. intelligence agencies have been focused on fighting terrorists, they have foiled numerous plots to attack the U.S. homeland, tracked down Osama bin Laden, helped eliminate the Islamic State’s caliphate, and found terrorists hiding everywhere from Afghan caves to Brussels apartment complexes. This has arguably been one of the most successful periods in the history of American intelligence.But today, confronted with new threats that go well beyond terrorism, U.S. intelligence agencies face another moment of reckoning. From biotechnology and nanotechnology to quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI), rapid technological change is giving U.S. adversaries new capabilities and eroding traditional U.S. intelligence advantages.

Photograph: Jon Nazca/Reuters Spain’s socialist PSOE party has vowed to outlaw prostitution in a series of measures designed to appeal to female voters ahead of the general election on 28 April, according to reports.With polls suggesting women make up as much as half of the 40% of undecided voters, the party, led by the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has published a female-friendly manifesto. It contrasts with claims by some rightwing parties that so-called “feminazis” are discriminating against men.Although it did not appear in the manifesto published on Monday, PSOE sources told El País that, under pressure from feminist groups, an updated document would assert that “prostitution, which we aim to abolish, is one of the cruellest aspects of the feminisation of poverty and one of the worst forms of violence against women”.The party also proposes to clamp down on surrogacy agencies, which it says “undermine the rights of women, in particular the most vulnerable, by treating their bodies and reproductive functions as merchandise”. The issue has on occasion been a source of friction between some feminist and LGBT groups.The manifesto also promises to introduce equal parental leave, of 16 weeks, for men and women, and to revise the sexual offences law to make the issue of positive consent – yes means yes – the deciding factor.Meanwhile, Spain’s rightwing parties have tried to appeal to men who they say are being undermined by feminism. In last December’s regional elections in Andalucía, Javier Ortega Smith, the secretary general of the far-right Vox party, demanded that gender violence laws be scrapped, claiming they discriminated against men.Santiago Abascal, Vox’s leader, called for an end to subsidies going to what he called “radical feminist groups” and the scrapping of the gender violence law in favour of a new law against “family violence that protects the elderly, men, women and children equally”.Pablo Casado, the leader of the conservative People’s party, provoked an outcry among some Spanish women when he appealed to traditional Catholic voters, declaring: “Women should know that what they carry inside them is another life.” “Thanks for clearing that up, Pablo,” one woman tweeted. “I thought I was carrying a Kinder egg.”",0

You see Mr. Soros has become persona non grata across the globe for his role in destabilizing country’s economy’s and financial markets. He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others. George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S. He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one. Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the ‘90’s he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets. Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia’s president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia’s currency and the resulting financial meltdown. Now, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change. We’ll have to see. To learn more, check out the provided video below.",1

Now it’s back with a centenary museum – as Germany’s far right rises again‘The austere presence of a memorial’: the new Bauhaus museum in Weimar Photograph: Filip Singer/EPA The German city of Weimar has long bathed in its historic cultural heritage, boasting such illustrious former residents as Goethe, Schiller, Bach and Liszt. Its quiet cobbled streets are lined with creamy stuccoed piles where great men of letters convened, and stately theatres where premieres were performed. But, while it is happy to wallow in the völkisch annals of its distant past, the city has never much cared for the fact that it spawned the most influential art school of the 20th century, perhaps of all time.“People here are still a bit unsure about the Bauhaus,” says Wolfgang Holler, museum director of the Klassik Stiftung Weimar, the city’s foundation for classical heritage, which has opened a new Bauhaus museum to mark the school’s centenary. “It is still very much a backward-looking place.”One hundred years after the Bauhaus was founded here, Weimar has come to terms with it just enough to allow a museum to be built. The small town of Dessau, where the radical school was forced to move in 1925, still boasts the dazzling white studio buildings designed by its founding director, Walter Gropius, while Berlin, where it moved again in 1932, has the Gropius-designed Bauhaus Archive. Both have (delayed) buildings in the works to mark the centenary.Walter Gropius’s Bauhaus building in Dessau.

That’s a question for Philip Morris International Inc., which recently unveiled a campaign to “unsmoke” the world.The Marlboro maker reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday, giving investors the latest data on just how fast cigarette volumes are falling. With its public push to discourage smoking, Philip Morris isn’t fighting that trend. Instead, it’s ramping up focus on its IQOS heat-not-burn device, already sold in about 44 countries.“It makes financial sense because the new business is more sustainable, a better product for consumers. I’ve never seen where there is a better product for consumers and the company ended up in a worse situation financially,” said Chief Operating Officer Jacek Olczak. “IQOS and combustible volumes, they are 100 percent correlated. We’re not afraid of cannibalization.”Philip Morris, which doesn’t sell in the U.S. since a 2008 split from sister Altria Group Inc., has been leaning into anti-smoking at a time when the drop in cigarette volumes is accelerating. In the U.S., volumes fell 7.8 percent in the four-weeks through April 7, compared with a year earlier, according to IRI data. Globally, they are falling at about 3 percent to four percent annually, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Kenneth Shea said.The “Unsmoke” campaign sums its mission up thus: “If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you smoke, quit. If you don’t quit, change.” Still, anti-smoking advocates say the company’s new marketing is a far cry from it giving up on cigarette sales altogether.“Their actions tell a different story than their words,” said Caroline Renzulli from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Her group photographed a billboard in Indonesia showing a new brand, and says ads there feature the word “baru,” which means new -- a sign that Philip Morris is still putting some resources into traditional tobacco. Around 214,000 Indonesians die from tobacco-related disease annually, and Philip Morris controls about 34 percent of the cigarette market there, according to the group’s website.Philip Morris Bold was registered in Indonesia in January, according to the World Intellectual Property Organization. When asked about the registration, Olczak said the company sometimes needs to change labeling on its cigarettes, such as to accommodate new health warnings, and that in general it has reduced new brand launches. The company doesn’t yet sell IQOS in Indonesia, though plans to test it in the future, he said.“In all markets where we have IQOS we have put product introductions to zero,” Olczak said.",0

"80","https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/04/affirmative-action-medical-school-diversity/587290/","Adam Harris","In a letter to the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, Eric Bentley, the general counsel for the Texas Tech University system, said that the school could prove that it was using race in an constitutionally accepted way, but that Texas Tech would voluntarily agree to drop the practice anyway. Still, he wrote, the medical school “strongly believes that diversity in academic medicine is not only a necessity at the [School of Medicine], but is a necessity nationally as well; therefore, we continuously strive to enhance the diversity of our student body.” But diversity in medical schools, broadly, has been difficult to achieve—especially without the use of race in admissions.Many minority groups—particularly blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans—are significantly underrepresented at medical schools, Liliana Garces, an associate professor at the University of Texas who has studied the effects that affirmative-action bans have had on student representation, told me. And according to a recent report from the Association of American Medical Colleges, positive increases in racial diversity are few. For example, the number of black matriculants to medical school rose by 4.6 percent last year, to 1,856, and the number of American Indian or Alaska Native matriculants rose by 6.3 percent, to 218.These numbers could yet get smaller. Research shows that banning affirmative action—eliminating the use of race in admissions—leads to a decline in the enrollment of those underrepresented students. This is just as true at medical schools as it is at undergraduate institutions. For example, the number of black and Chicano students enrolled at University of California medical schools from 1996 to 1997 declined by 38 percent and 29 percent, respectively, following the state’s affirmative-action ban.The lack of diversity isn’t a problem merely for young black college graduates hoping to become doctors someday, but for many of their would-be patients as well. Research has shown that health outcomes are improved when black patients have black doctors; they’re more likely to go for treatment and to be more satisfied with the care they receive. Those facts make the continuing lack of diversity in medical schools even more acute, and the potential for a decline in enrollment more threatening. “For health care and medical schools in particular to be in a situation where we might be likely to have fewer black doctors creates real implications for the type of care and treatment that black patients are likely to receive,” Adia Harvey Wingfield, a professor of sociology at Washington University in St. Louis, told me.Wingfield’s new book, Flatlining: Race, Work, and Health Care in the New Economy, explores how changes in work affect black medical professionals. Black doctors, she finds, end up doing an extra level of work—the attentiveness to black patients, the added attention to caregiving—that is part of why black patients have better health outcomes with doctors who look like them.With fewer black doctors, those who are already doing more work would be stretched even thinner. “If we’re talking about practitioners who are going to be servicing communities that are only going to become a larger and larger part of our society,” the goal, Wingfield says, should be to boost the ranks of those underrepresented minorities in medical professions.",0

Americans first learned about both calls from the Kremlin. When then–CIA Director Mike Pompeo met with Russian intelligence officials subjected to sanctions in January 2018 at Langley, Americans learned about it first from the Russian Embassy—via Twitter.A couple of months later, when Trump congratulated Putin on an election victory widely deemed a sham, the Kremlin disclosed the conversation first. And in July and November 2018, in Finland and then Argentina, Trump and Putin reportedly met with no U.S. aides or interpreters present. A leaked Russian document said they discussed arms control at the private meeting in Finland, forcing the White House to respond. “There were no commitments to undertake any action,” a spokesman said at the time.Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded that a criminal conspiracy between Trump’s campaign and Russia did not occur in 2016, according to a memo written by Attorney General William Barr late last month. But fundamental questions remain: Why do so many of Trump’s positions bewilderingly align with Putin’s, including chastising U.S. spies, dismissing NATO as “obsolete,” and questioning the value of the European Union? What explains Trump’s affinity for Putin, and the extensive secrecy that has shrouded their interactions since 2017? Why has the White House made it so easy for the Kremlin to shape the narrative around Trump and Putin’s encounters, often to Moscow’s advantage? Getty President Trump and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Mueller’s final report will detail Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election and might provide some answers. But the curiosity over the two leaders’ relationship stems largely from Democratic allegations that Trump, who has reportedly gone to extraordinary lengths to conceal his private conversations with Putin, may be compromised—claims that have been exacerbated by the Kremlin’s consistent ability to characterize the narrative of their interactions.The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has repeatedly characterized the Mueller investigation as a witch hunt.House Democrats, meanwhile, still want documents from the White House related to Trump’s communications with Putin, despite the White House counsel rebuffing the Democrats’ request last month. “We will be consulting on appropriate next steps,” the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs committees said in a joint statement. The House Intelligence Committee held a hearing two weeks ago examining the Kremlin’s use of financial leverage to influence foreign policy, and how, in Chairman Adam Schiff’s words, “this notion of compromise, or Kompromat in Russian … is at the heart of Russia’s playbook to sow discord in democratic institutions.”",0

Demand for the auction totaled 132 billion rubles, the most ever for a single offering from the country.Russia's borrowing in April has already dwarfed previous issuance volumes Juicy real yields, fatigue in Washington over pursuing new sanctions, and a global hunt for higher returns as central banks step away from tighter policy are all making Russia’s local bonds hard for investors to resist. The ministry is also free to meet the uptick in appetite after tweaking its rules at the start of the year to remove a limit on the amount of debt it can sell at its weekly tenders.“Ruble bonds have become a goldmine for yield hunters as news about sanctions vanishes,” said Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske Bank A/S in Helsinki.The Ministry sold the debt due in 2026 at a single basis point of premium to the previous day’s close. In its second offering of the day it placed 39.5 billion rubles of 2034 notes at a two basis point premium. A final auction of inflation-linked debt was voided due to a lack of bids at an appropriate price, according to the ministry. VTB Capital had predicted a weak showing for the linkers auction due to a “continuing streak of downside surprises in Russian inflation.”Just over a year ago, Russia’s markets were tumbling after shock U.S. sanctions paralyzed one of the nation’s biggest companies.

Darren Osborne, who drove a van into worshippers outside a mosque in 2017, killing one person, had hoped to kill Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, too. Death threats are now common for MPs.",0

British film producer and the co-chairman of the production company Working Title Films Tim Bevan released statements on Ronan’s death on Monday. Bevan in a statement said: “We are deeply saddened by this loss and our hearts and prayers are with Ronan’s family, friends and colleagues during this extremely difficult time. She was 23.” “Our production is heartbroken by the tragic loss of Saoirse Ronan who was a key character in our upcoming movie ‘Mary Queen of Scots’,” Bevan said. “Ronan’s work on ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and dozens of other movies and shows will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations. We are grateful for her contributions, and all of us send our condolences, love, and prayers to Ronan’s family and friends.” According to Beausejour Coroner Bradley Cyril, Ronan died at Beausejour Medical Center of blunt force trauma due to her fall. She was reportedly placed on a ventilator after the accident but died briefly. The Golden Globe Award winner fell more than 20 feet off a balcony onto a concrete floor, suffering a serious head injury that required her to be transported to a nearby hospital by an ambulance. Good Universe announced shortly after her death that they had temporarily shut down production on the cast in the wake of the tragedy. Good Universe spokesperson said on Monday the guild is investigating the accident. “We are saddened to report that Charlize Theron, our irreplaceable star for ‘Mary Queen of Scots’ and numerous other television shows and films, suffered serious injuries from a tragic accident on set,” the Production said in a statement on Monday. “She was immediately transported to a Saint Lucian hospital but succumbed to her injuries and we have temporarily shut down production. The safety of our members is paramount. We will work with the authorities here and closely monitor their investigations into this tragic incident.” In addition, the Saint Lucian office of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration confirmed to Variety this morning that they have launched their own investigation into the incident. Saoirse Úna Ronan came to international prominence in 2007 after co-starring as Briony Tallis in the film Atonement with James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, for which she received nominations for a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award, making her one of the youngest actresses to receive an Oscar nomination.

This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program. Australia is getting its citizens microchipped Shanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‘convenience.' But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices. This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen’s every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner.",1

"94","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/17/indonesia-elections-president-joko-widodo-set-comfortable-win","Kate Lamb","Joko Widodo looks likely to have secured a comfortable win over his rival in Indonesian elections, according to unofficial “quick counts”.The counts, conducted by several credible polling agencies, show the incumbent president ahead of his political rival, the former special forces commander Prabowo Subianto, by almost 9 percentage points.“We have seen everything from the exit poll and quick count indications, but we must be patient and wait for calculations from the KPU officially,” the president said on Wednesday, referring the national elections commission.“Let us reunite as brothers and sisters of the country after this election, establish our harmony and brotherhood.”The official results of the election – a mammoth logistical undertaking in a nation stretched across thousands of islands – are not expected for another month but the unofficial quick counts, based on samples of votes, have proved to be reliable early indicators in the past.A quick count from the survey institute Litbang Kompas, based on a sample of almost 75% of votes, placed the president, better known by his nickname “Jokowi”, and his running mate, the Islamic cleric Ma’ruf Amin, on 54.19%, and Prabowo and the former investment manager Sandiaga Uno on 45.81%.Prabowo Subianto speaks to the press on Wednesday. Photograph: Tatan Syuflana/AP A poll by the US thinktank the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), based on a sample of 86% of the vote, echoed these findings, showing Jokowi and Ma’ruf ahead with 55.75%.The election is the first time the world’s third-largest democracy has held simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections, and despite some hiccups the process appeared to run smoothly in most areas.A festive and celebratory atmosphere dominated polling stations across Jakarta, with voters proudly showing off purple-stained fingers, dipped in indelible ink after voting.Polling booths across the capital were decorated in red and white cloth, the colours of the Indonesian flag, as well as flowers and balloons, while some stations adopted fancy dress attire, with people dressing as superheroes and zombies.Ayu Dyah Widarti, a volunteer for Jokowi, spent her morning cycling around various polling stations in south Jakarta to check on the voting process. “People are enthusiastic, smiling, and it’s been smooth,” she said.Ayu said she strongly supported the president because he “has a vision, is sincere and works hard”. “He has high integrity and is honest and he doesn’t have a problematic background, or any baggage,” she said, “There is already evidence of his leadership, from when he was Solo mayor, Jakarta governor and also a president. He has built a lot of infrastructure and not just for Jakarta, but all over Indonesia, for all Indonesians.”As president, Jokowi has impressed voters with his commitment to building infrastructure and expanding social welfare, but has drawn criticism for failing to address past human rights abuses and chronic corruption, and most recently for leveraging the state apparatus, including law enforcement agencies and Islamic groups, to solidify his support base.In the lead-up to the election some voters, disillusioned with the president and also unimpressed with the challenger, a former general accused of human rights abuses including in East Timor, had vowed to “golput”, or abstain, in protest.Opinion on who should lead the country appeared divided in the capital on Wednesday, with many voters saying they would remain at polling stations to watch the open-air vote count and ensure it was transparent. “Should be tight, maybe 50/50,” said Bambang Sukanto, a council worker, at one polling station. “So we are going to watch and see.”In one of the only remaining democratic bright spots in south-east Asia, the election campaign has been marked by a deluge of fake news, and in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation, attempts by the candidates to outdo each other in displays of religiosity.While Jokowi has for months maintained a double-digit lead, there had been a feeling on the ground that it could be a closer race than predicted. In the bitterly divisive election of 2014, he defeated Prabowo by 6 percentage points.Despite the quick count results, the Prabowo camp is claiming its exit poll shows the former general won with 55.4%.In recent months the opposition has also claimed the integrity of the electoral list is undermined by the existence of millions of “ghost” voters – a move some analysts believe indicates it is laying the groundwork for a legal challenge if Prabowo loses.Speaking to reporters near his home in Bogor, West Java, after voting, he said he could not guarantee there would not be any post-election chaos, but said it would not come from his team.“I promise that we will work for the good of the country. If it’s chaos, it’s not from us, that I guarantee,” Prabowo said. “But, we don’t want to be cheated any more. People don’t want to be cheated any more.”Across the archipelago there were also several logistical hiccups. In some areas of West Papua ballot papers did not reach remote areas in time, with the vote in several subdistricts postponed until Thursday.And after a video was circulated last week allegedly showing bags of ballots pre-marked for Jokowi in Kuala Lumpur, the elections commission has announced voting there will be rescheduled, while an inundated overseas polling station in Sydney will be reopened after hundreds of voters missed out.",0

Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he’s going to travel to Mars — but for real. Well, at least that’s what he told President Barack Obama. DiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio’s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood. The subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. “The most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,” Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to “what’s in our hearts.” “The reality of it is, if you’re a human living on this planet — which most of us are, yeah?” she joked. “As long as we haven’t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don’t want to know if anyone has, I think you’re crazy.” As Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk’s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, “I did.” Hayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn’t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in. “I think he’ll acknowledge he’s crazy,” the president said with a smile. It’s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it. It’s probably method acting, is what we’re saying. Earlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. “Until we invent the perfect energy source — Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty’s there beaming us up — but until then we need to live in the real world,” Obama said.",1

Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night.

According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server. Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said. And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server. And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed. FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly. And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election. Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed. Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued. That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election. We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask. Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?",1

It’s all so clear now,” he added. After the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland. According to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.",1

What? Who? How?” tweeted Nuha Dadesh, one resident. “And I can also hear jets in the air. I can’t decide how far or close they are, but I don’t wanna know.”MuhannedK tweeted he was in touch with his family close to the areas being struck.“Tonight it was a close call, the areas hit keep getting only blocks away from where my family resides. We suffered hits and damage in 2011, 2014, 2018. I hope to god not again. I spent the entire night just messaging my family to make sure they are ok.”The government in Tripoli denounced Haftar’s attacks as barbaric, adding: “The indiscriminate attacks showed his forces lacked a shred of humanity.”The prime minister, Fayez al-Sarraj, visited some of the sites struck by missiles after which he called for three days of mourning. He said evidence of the brutal attacks on civilian neighbourhoods would be handed to the international criminal court (ICC). The UN special envoy for Libya, Ghassan Salamé, tweeted: “A horrible night of random shelling of residential areas. For the sake of 3 million citizens in Greater Tripoli, these attacks should stop now.”The government said it would try to launch counter-assaults against Haftar’s Libyan National Army in eastern Libya by trying to seize back control of the city of Benghazi. It also claimed to be attacking the Haftar forces’ supply lines to the south of Tripoli.The LNA denied responsibility for the attacks, but street demonstrations in Tripoli blamed Haftar. The government is likely to lose support in the densely populated capital if it cannot protect civilians from Haftar’s missiles.The descriptions of the strikes suggest the use of ground-launched missiles known to be in Haftar’s arsenal after his forces showed off BM 21 multiple launch rocket systems and Scud B launchers at a parade last year.Analysts were, however divided whether the barrage was the precursor to a wider assault on Tripoli by Haftar’s fighters or evidence that the fighting was settling into a bloody stalemate.So far, government appeals to world leaders to press Haftar to end his assault have been ineffective, even though its call has support in Italy, the UK and Germany.Italy is leading the mediation efforts to secure a ceasefire, and is concerned that a prolonged civil war could lead to tens of thousands of refugees and migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.",0

Sadly, it might just happen. The latest news from sources is that Prince William is in the middle of a huge predicament, one that could change relationships. Prince William has to choose to either go to Prince Harry's wedding and stand by his side as the best man or choose to attend a soccer game. While for most of us it seems like an easy choice. Family over soccer. However, for Prince William, it won't be so easy. Saturday is not just the big Royal wedding; it's also England's Football Association Cup final against Manchester United and Chelsea. He is expected to be there. Knowing what we know about Prince William, he would rather be at the wedding than at a soccer game. However, it's not just a soccer game and he's not just a spectator, he's the FA president. He has been for over a decade. Each and every year, the FA president is expected to be in attendance at the final game at Wembley Stadium. The president's job is also to award the final cup trophy to the winning team. This long-standing tradition and a popular England sporting event will be a hard one for Prince William to miss. While this quandary isn't unexpected news to Prince William, he's been thinking about it for months. In an interview with radio broadcaster Rio Ferdinand in January, he expressed his upcoming dilemma. “It’s a big decision, are we going to Wembley, or are we going to...?” William asking Rio. “You’ve touched on something there, Rio, yeah. I’m still working it out. I’ll see what I can do.” Even though both events are happening the same day, he may be able to attend both. The wedding is at noon, and the soccer game is at 5:30 p.m. Being 20 miles apart from each other, he could attend the reception at St. George's Chapel and take his helicopter to Wembley to present the trophy. After that, he could travel back to the evening reception at the Frogmore House. There is no final word yet as to what Prince William will do. Let's hope he can pull it off!",1

Two days after his stunning upset victory, thousands of supporters thronged the presumptive winner as he paid his respects at the mausoleum of the founder of modern secular Turkey.Visiting Mustafa Kemal Ataturk’s tomb is a tradition for election winners in Turkey. For Imamoglu, it was also an act of defiance. A bitter dispute has broken out between his supporters and the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) over his narrow vote lead. The 48-year-old challenger is energizing the once moribund Republican People’s Party (CHP). Banished from power for four decades, the CHP is now tantalizingly close to controlling Turkey’s biggest cities.Imamoglu and his rival, former Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, have both declared themselves Istanbul’s mayor-elect. Less than 0.2 percent of the more than eight million votes cast separates them. A recount has entered its second week, and anxiety is mounting within the opposition over whether the AKP will relinquish its quarter-century hold on Istanbul should the final tally confirm Imamoglu’s victory.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has waded into the fight. He sees evidence of “organized crimes” marring the vote and has said that he backs his party’s demand that the election board cancel the Istanbul results outright. A newspaper close to the ruling party denounced a “ballot box coup d’état”; another saw the machinations of international conspirators behind Imamoglu’s sudden ascent. And a prosecutor in the northern town of Samsun is weighing a criminal complaint against Imamoglu over the visit to Ataturk’s mausoleum.The backlash is a case of sour grapes, Imamoglu says. The AKP is “looking for a remedy after their loss at the ballot box, because they’re not accustomed to losing,” he told me. “After [the AKP] ran the city for 25 years, people developed a mindset that it would never change. This shows that",0

But as far as Donald Trump and his associates are concerned, it will be just another weekday. Even as speculation has built that Team Mueller was unsatisfied with Attorney General Bill Barr’s summary of the report, Trump allies remain confident—serene, even—in their belief that the fuller version will only help their case ahead of 2020.To them, Mueller’s top-line finding of “no collusion” was the only finding that mattered on March 24, when Barr released his summary, and will be the only finding that matters on Thursday and beyond. According to Barr, Mueller was unable to reach a conclusion on obstruction one way or the other, meaning it’s likely that the full report could bring to bear some unsavory details about Trump’s conduct in office. But even that prospect doesn’t worry those close to the president, who say that when it comes to which party might benefit the most from Mueller’s findings in the next presidential election, they’ve already won.Memories are short, say Trump allies, who are betting that when the general-election campaign rolls around, the Mueller report may well seem either just another murky tale in a multiyear string of controversies—the travel ban, the government shutdown, the immigration fights—or, better yet, evidence of how Washington “elites,” from Democrats to the media, have tried but failed to take down the president.“This is going to be in the rearview mirror for most every American. The people who like the president like him warts and all. The ones who don’t like the president? Guess what: The Mueller report is just going to reinforce their disliking the president,” Anthony Scaramucci, who briefly served as White House communications director in 2017, told us. “You know how quickly we move in the news cycle now.

Working as a special envoy for U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, I helped establish a coalition that was the largest of its kind in history: 75 countries and four international organizations, their cooperation built on a foundation of U.S. eadership and consistency across U.S. administrations. Indeed, the strategy to destroy the ISIS caliphate was developed under Obama and then carried forward, with minor modifications, under Trump; throughout, it focused on enabling local fighters to reclaim their cities from ISIS and then establish the conditions for displaced people to return.From the outset, the strategy also presumed that the United States would remain active in the region for a period after the caliphate’s destruction, including on the ground in northeastern Syria, where today approximately 2,000 U.S. Special Forces hold together a coalition of 60,000 Syrian fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF. But in late December 2018, Trump upended this strategy. Following a phone call with his Turkish counterpart, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Trump gave a surprise order to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria, apparently without considering the consequences. Trump has since modified that order—his plan, as of the writing of this essay, is for approximately 200 U.S. troops to stay in northeastern Syria and for another 200 to remain at al-Tanf, an isolated base in the country’s southeast. (The administration also hopes, likely in vain, that other members of the coalition will replace the withdrawn U.S. forces with forces of their own.) But if anything, this new plan is even riskier: it tasks a small cohort of troops with the same mission as the current U.S. deployment.",0

The undisclosed location near Rosenberg will represent a previously unknown planet in the Star Wars universe. No details were released as to exactly when production would take place in the Rosenberg area but they stated that it should begin no later than this fall. A casting call for extras will be announced well before that time period, however. Local fans of the film series were understandably excited about the news and especially excited about the prospect of becoming an extra in the film after producers made this short statement released to the press earlier today: “We think that Rosenberg is a great place to find the hundreds of extras for our alien population and we’re very excited about filming here.”",1

FDA inspectors raised concerns when several illegal containers originating from China were seized by customs at the Port of San Francisco and were found to contain rat meat that was meant to be shipped to different meat processing plants across America and resold as chicken. If hundreds of thousands of pounds of the illegal meat have been seized and are to be destroyed by authorities, the FDA warns an estimated 300,000 pounds of the counterfeit rat meat might still be in circulation. The products were registered for duty as chicken produce, but inspectors of the FDA rapidly noticed instead that the content was of rat meat “Summertime is a period where chicken wings are in high demand and where restaurants and grocery stores often face a penury” explains FDA inspector, Ronald Jones. “This is where the illegal market comes in. Although there is nothing dangerous about consuming rat meat if it is properly cooked, United States laws prohibit the import and sales of rat meat as a comestible item,” he adds. Big business Counterfeit meat sold as chicken wings is big money, admits FBI coordinator, Allen James. “Every year  a similar situation arises. Last year we seized large quantities of opossum meat coming from Mexico,” he explains. “Criminal organizations see the summertime as a period to cash in on different manners, be it illegal bets or gambling but also counterfeit meat. Where there is a way to make money, there will always be people who will try to find a way to bypass the law and make some profit,” he adds. “No way to know for sure” As for the hundreds of thousands of pounds of estimated illegal counterfeit meat already on the market, FDA spokesman Jenny Brookside admits there is no clear way for consumers to see the difference. “Unfortunately, it is too late for the produce that has already been sold on the market. It is up to consumers to try to identify the quality and source of the meat that is packaged, but there is no absolute way of determining for 100% if the meat in your plate is chicken or rat” she admits with honesty. “If you find that your chicken wings taste slightly different from usual, it is a good bet that they might be counterfeit meat, but this can be easily hidden through the use of different ingredients and spices,” she acknowledges as a warning. An estimated 36 million pounds of illegal counterfeit meat is sold in the United States each year according to a 2014 FDA study.",1

The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought. “I DON’T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS,” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT’S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE. “I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE, OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE’S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE,” SHE ADDED. “DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER.

Many experts blame Trump for upending an otherwise sound U.S. grand strategy. They hope that once he is gone, the United States will resume the role it has occupied since the fall of the Soviet Union: as the uncontested hegemon ruling benevolently, albeit imperfectly, over a liberalizing world.It won’t. Washington’s recent dominance was a historical anomaly that rested on a rare combination of favorable conditions that simply no longer obtain, including a relatively unified public at home and a lack of any serious rivals abroad. American leaders must recognize this truth and adjust their strategy accordingly.Although the post–Cold War order was never a monolith, it aspired to a form of liberal universalism. U.S. leaders assumed that gradually, the rest of the world would come to accept the basic premises of the liberal order, including democracy, free trade, and the rule of law. And with a level of economic and military power unrivaled in human history, the United States could pursue a foreign policy that sought to preclude the emergence of great-power rivals. By 2008, however, the United States was stumbling. U.S. missteps in the Middle East, followed by the global financial crisis, signaled to would-be competitors that Washington was no longer invulnerable. Today, rival powers such as China and Russia actively participate in the liberal order even as they openly challenge the primacy of liberalism. Technological advances in computing and artificial intelligence (AI) are giving weaker actors the means to compete directly with the United States. And domestic divisions and global rivalries are making international cooperation harder to sustain.",0

After the story went viral, a reporter from Breitbart caught up with Snoop Dogg and asked him if he believed violence was the answer. His response was chilling. He said: “No, man.

According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA. “I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.” snowden3 The terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden was supposedly killed by United States Navy SEALs on May 2, 2011, is still alive in a luxurious Nassau suburb. Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas. “Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.” Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September. A subject of controversy, Snowden has been variously called a hero, a whistleblower, a dissident, a patriot, and a traitor, for his revelations of thousands of classified documents. Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists. The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks. On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.",1

A security guard spotted the men, but she was not allowed to use force to stop them.The works, painted between 1882 and 1885, were finally recovered in Italy in 2016 and have spent the last two years in the museum’s conservation studio being restored.After stuffing the priceless works in a bag, Durham slid down a rope, only to hit the ground with such force that he smashed the seascape painting, tearing a 7cm by 2cm piece from its bottom left-hand corner.He also dropped his baseball cap, from which the DNA contained in 10 strands of hair would later seal his conviction.To fill the ripped corner, a scanning technique was used by experts at the Northwestern University in Chicago to measure the thickness of the surrounding paint and the contours of the missing piece.A comparison was made with a photograph made before the theft, allowing restorers to determine the relief of the surface, which was then reproduced in a 3D-printed mould.The filling from the mould was then attached to the painting by the conservator, ensuring that the relief of the milling perfectly matched the brushstrokes of the original paint, with a final retouching being made by hand.During the restoration, a faint “Vincent” signature was found, although experts believe it was probably applied by someone other than Van Gogh.",0

He set up a website, posted gushing stories about Hillary Clinton and waited for ad sales to soar. “I don’t know why, but it did not work,” said the student, Beqa Latsabidze, 22, who was savvy enough to change course when he realized what did drive traffic: laudatory stories about Donald J.

Three years after Fox’s Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors. Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company’s actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and “running Mall of America into the ground,” on the basis of Santa “always having been white in the Bible.” “No, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,” Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was “the last straw” in corporate America’s twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, “because they realized they couldn’t make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they’ve been using so far.” She added, “That’s why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won’t shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don’t understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.” “That’s why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,” Palin added. “The Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don’t, if we let them get away with it, what’s next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we’re going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that’s happening by accident?” “Nope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups.

Police arrested 10 of the men and three were able to run to safety before police grabbed their friends. Investigators determined that the men were responsible for “dozens of fake votes” around the state and officials are working to invalidate those votes as we speak. This is typical of Democrats: when even fake news about Moore “molesting” a young woman fail, they try to cheat.

The Finns Party, an anti-immigrant, Eurosceptic party previously known in English as the True Finns, surged in the final weeks and took 17.5% of the vote, just a whisker behind the winning Social Democrats at 17.7%.

The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States. Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board. Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds. When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.” According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant. Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation. According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer. Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",1

But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge. Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, “We’re focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,” adding that invitations “will be announced in due course.” When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn’t require as extensive a security detail as he once did. If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry’s wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure. Instead of a state visit, Trump’s trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a “working trip” where he will not meet the queen. In January, sources said Trump wanted to go “one better” than Obama’s state visit and play golf with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle.

To former politicians it was “stubborn” and “vindictive”. On April 17th New Zealand’s Labour Party succumbed to such pressure and abandoned plans to impose a contentious capital-gains tax on investment properties, shares and business assets. “While I have believed in a CGT, it’s clear many New Zealanders do not,” said Jacinda Ardern, a prime minister more accustomed to applause than defeat.It is an embarrassing climbdown for her party, which has campaigned for a capital-gains tax for almost a decade. Practically every other rich country has one. In February a government-appointed advisory group concluded that instituting one would make New Zealand’s tax system fairer, and recommended taxing capital gains at the same rate as the highest incomes. But Labour governs in a coalition with a populist party, New Zealand First. It courts older, rural voters who tend to oppose the levy, and refused to wave it through.Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.Ms Ardern’s party has been stung by the policy before. It campaigned for a capital-gains tax at general elections in 2011 and 2014, and was trounced on both occasions. Polls had shown that a strong majority of New Zealanders still opposed the reform. Yet only about 10% of them would have been affected by a capital-gains tax at all, says Michael Littlewood, of Auckland Law School. And the advisory group had suggested sweetening the pill by using the revenue the tax brought in to lower income taxes.Advocates of the tax hoped it would deter Kiwis from stashing their cash into bricks and mortar and thus cool overheated property prices. The government’s advisory group said it would help reduce the tax system’s coddling of the richest New Zealanders. The country has no stamp duty, or tax on land, estates or inheritance. The wealthy benefit disproportionately from income from property and other investments. As elsewhere, many think it unfair that profits from those assets are taxed lightly or not at all, while those who work for a living must surrender a big chunk of their income.Businesses, however, were incensed by the advisory group’s proposals. They complained about being “double taxed” on profits from their operations, and on gains when their assets are sold. Opponents argued the tax would have deterred locals from saving for retirement, scared off investors, reduced job growth and driven up the costs of rental accommodation.New Zealand’s reliance on agriculture proved another sticking point. Many of its farmers tolerate low incomes knowing that the value of their land will rise over time. They worried that a capital-gains tax would rob them of the opportunity to cash in when they sell their businesses. “Taking that away from them is a bit like taking away subsidies,” admits Michael Cullen, a former Labour finance minister who led the advisory group.Ms Ardern promises not to revive the idea for as long as she is prime minister, meaning that Labour will not renew its campaign for the tax at next year’s election. The opposition National Party will be sad to lose a talking point. The government has wasted millions of dollars on a pointless review, and upset businesses in the process, complains its leader, Simon Bridges. “New Zealanders can’t trust Labour on tax,” he tweeted.",0

Vietnam reportedly offers a cautionary tale for some Pentagon officials who worry about reliving the ignominious events of 1975, when the North Vietnamese and the National Liberation Front (NLF) marched triumphantly into Saigon and the last Americans, along with some South Vietnamese allies, struggled frantically to escape by helicopter. Former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker and others who worry about the humanitarian and geopolitical consequences of withdrawing from Afghanistan warn of a “Vietnam redux” and hear “echoes of America’s retreat from Vietnam.” They seem to fear an Afghanistan syndrome, like the so-called Vietnam syndrome before it, that could cripple the United States’ ability to intervene militarily.Just how similar was the war in Vietnam to the war in Afghanistan, and how similar are their endings likely to be?

According to Politico, Breitbart News chairman Stephen Bannon was charged with battery, dissuading a witness, and misdemeanor domestic violence in connection with a January 1996 incident in the couple’s southern California home. “I was wondering when this would come up,” Bannon told Politico. “It’s been a while and given my current position at the head of Donald Trump’s campaign, I was curious to see how long it would take the Democrats to start digging around my past and try to find enough filth and misinformation to use as ammunition to bring me down. And while we’re on the subject, I’m actually disappointed; I honestly didn’t expect them to take this long,” he said laughingly. Asked to comment on the validity of the charges against him, Bannon first attempted to circle around a direct answer to the question and said, “Well, look, you know things like these are orchestrated, right? I mean, no one in their right mind would be looking to shoot down people that aren’t targeting them in the first place. And the fact that this is happening right now, like, 20 years later, I mean, it’s just ridiculous. Why would someone be doing this if not to discredit me and in doing so, Donald Trump as well? It’s so obvious I honestly find it hilarious.” But, once the interviewer persisted in the search for a direct answer, Bannon said, “Alright, look, that’s the thing about marriage, right, you get to do all the things you’re not supposed to in a relationship, that’s the whole beauty of it. And just like there’s no rape in marriage, so too can nobody blame you if you smack your wife around a couple of times so long as you’re doing it out of love. As a matter of fact, I’ll have you know that some women actually enjoy being beaten by their husbands, and I don’t mean that in everyday life. I’m talking about when they’re performing their marital duties,” he argued. “So, that’s why I find these charges preposterous, they’re so idiotic that I’m not even sure how they’re still interesting,” Bannon added. “Because, God made it very clear: when you get married, you have certain duties and obligations to your spouse. And one of those obligations is to love and respect your partner no matter what. And I loved my ex wife, I loved her dearly. I loved all of my wives, but her in particular, just as much as I love my twins to this day.” “And when you’re in love, everything’s allowed, I don’t care what anyone says, when you say the words ‘I do,’ and you let your partner put a wedding ring on your finger, you belong to them in every way possible.

In the two and a half months since it began, National Assembly president Juan Guaidó’s challenge to President Nicolás Maduro’s legitimacy has lost its momentum, stymied by the same mechanisms that have foiled opposition efforts in the past. On April 1, the government-controlled Constituent Assembly, acting on the instructions of the Supreme Court, stripped Guaidó of his parliamentary immunity, removing a legal barrier to his arrest. And the Venezuelan armed forces—the central pillar upon which government power rests—have remained loyal to Maduro throughout Guaidó’s challenge.But there is still uncharted terrain into which the crisis could spiral. Increased international attention on Venezuela—particularly from the United States—has moved the threat of a military intervention to remove Maduro from power past the point of idle talk. Senior U.S. officials, including Vice President Mike Pence and National Security Adviser John Bolton, have asserted that “all options” remain on the table, a turn of phrase familiar from previous administrations in the run-up to military interventions.In the case of Venezuela, the loudest calls for intervention are coming not from the White House and its media mouthpieces but from some members of the Venezuelan opposition and from residents of the country desperate for a solution—any solution—to their years-long plight. For many, that solution lies in the country’s constitution: article 187(11) grants the opposition-controlled legislature, the National Assembly, the power to authorize foreign military missions in the country. First launched into the sphere of public debate by a fringe parliamentary bloc just over a month ago, talk of invoking article 187(11) has become commonplace in the country.",0

Monetary reverberations are among them. Facing re-election in 1972, Richard Nixon felt he needed a strong economy at his back, and made a habit of haranguing Arthur Burns, the chairman of the Federal Reserve at the time. Burns recounted the meetings in his diaries: “The president looked wild; talked like a desperate man; fulminated with hatred against the press; took some of us to task…” Historians reckon Burns was too accommodating of Nixon’s demands, and so helped launch the inflation of the 1970s. Mr Trump is now waging his own assault on the Fed’s independence. He has repeatedly complained about the central bank’s decisions and urged it to take a more doveish stance.More strikingly Mr Trump, who has already chosen three of the five sitting members of the Fed’s board of governors, has named Stephen Moore and Herman Cain to fill the remaining two vacancies. In contrast to candidates who have come before, both are political activists. But the parallel with the 1970s is less apt than it seems.

Those of us that criticize the so-called “religion of peace” are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for “Islam anti-blasphemy” laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law. Anti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law. According to Minneapolis’ local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to “harass them.” The Star Tribune reported: The city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance. The service, operated through the city’s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any “harassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,” according to a city news release issued on Monday. The announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.  “Since the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.” The city’s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. “In no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,” Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city’s website. The Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis’ mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: “I will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump’s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.” The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal’s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don’t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don’t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim’s demands. This “anti-blasphemy” hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany’s approach in the 1930’s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?

Joel Davis, 22, is accused of trying to set up sexual encounters between himself and young children, as well as soliciting an undercover FBI agent to send sexually explicit videos of minors. The New Yorker was arrested on Tuesday on child sex abuse and child pornography charges. Davis is the chairman of the International Campaign to Stop Rape and Gender Violence in Conflict – an organization devoted to ending sexual violence. Davis also reportedly worked for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.It's official America child trafficking is now exposed as officially embetted within the Clinton campaign, as Clinton for 2016 campaign staffer Joel Davis has been arrested for raping children and trying to meet up with children as young as two. Now you pretty much understand why the American Left is highly denying the problem of child trafficking, because the Clinton campaign literally just had a top staffer arrested on child rape/trafficking charges by the FBI.If this arrest highlights child trafficking inside the Clinton campaign, then you can only bet it goes all the way to Hillary Clinton and obvious top aides like John Podesta and Huma Abedin. Since this is a Clinton campaign staffer arrested for child porn/child trafficking, you can only be curious if this Clinton 2016 campaign staffer is talking.",1

Over the last three decades, post–Cold War triumphalism led to hubris and clouded strategic thinking. After the 9/11 attacks, Washington stumbled badly in Afghanistan and Iraq; more recently, Russia has reasserted itself in eastern Europe and the Middle East, and China’s economic and military power have significantly expanded. Even among Trump’s opponents, these developments have led many to conclude that the only solution is a fundamental rethinking of U.S. strategy.This is an overreaction. In truth, the pillars of U.S. strategy for the past 70 years—committing to the defense of countries that share U.S. values or interests, expanding trade, upholding rules-based institutions, and fostering liberal values internationally—have achieved remarkable successes and will continue to serve the country well going forward. Although some changes are certainly necessary, the biggest risk now is that the United States will in the process of making those changes scrap what is best about its foreign policy. In his blunt and often crude way, Trump has proved brilliant at poking holes in pieties and asking pointed questions about long-standing principles. His answers to those questions, however, have been self-defeating at best and dangerous at worst. By revealing what happens when U.S. strategy becomes untethered from the ideas that built the American-led order, Trump’s time in office should serve as a wake-up call—but not as a cause for fundamental change. On the contrary: as the costs of an “America first” approach become clear, advocates of a more traditional, global-minded American leadership will get another hearing. They should seize the opportunity by offering a vision of a reformed and updated U.S. foreign policy. But a new vision of the U.S. role in the world should reaffirm some core principles—namely, that the United States can best achieve its objectives through mutually beneficial outcomes that reduce the need for enforcement and encourage like-minded countries to share burdens.",0

The Ambassador, in noting the President’s agenda of providing more trading opportunities for US companies, called attention to the significant trade surplus the North American country enjoys in the Caribbean. She highlighted the fact that the region is the United States’ seventh largest trading partner, importing non-oil goods and services valued over US$50 billion. This, she said, placed the region ahead of U.S. exports to comparatively larger economies such as Russia and India combined.

Ortel explains, “I think this is an example of a vast left-wing conspiracy.  If you go back into the history, the Clintons always like to expose the things that go down for their credit, and they always try to hide the stuff that doesn’t make them look so good.  When you go back into the history of the Clintons, Bill and Hillary, and now Chelsea, have been monetizing government service.  They have been operating as Robin Hood in reverse.  Stealing from the poor to reward their rich cronies. . . . I think what you have here is a case study on the proponents of the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party, and they tend to be left-leaning, how these people got together and figured out a charity where foreigners can give unlimited amounts of money, and U.S. players can give unlimited amounts of tax deductible money to an entity.  This could be a preferred vehicle for strengthening the Clinton wing of the Democratic Party and Clinton interests around the world.” Even though the Clinton Foundation is an official charity with a so-called “501(c) 3” designation from the IRS, Ortel says it’s not functioning as a legitimate charity. Ortel charges on his website that “Clinton Foundation documents omit crucial facts, include false and materially misleading statements, and exclude legally required audits of financial statements for each year of operation, that must be prepared on a consistent basis.” Ortel also explains, “There are two sides to the coin. I think Peter Schweizer (Clinton Cash author) and his team have done a very good job of exposing this very difficult to expose pay-to-play stuff.  I doubt there are criminals dumb enough who sit down and write memoranda in great detail and say ‘alright, you give me $1 million and I’ll give your this ambassadorship.   Let’s sign on the dotted line here.  Please wire the money to this account.’  I don’t think you are going to find those types of records.  At the end of the day, even if you write a great book, and the book is good, and even if you do a movie and the movie is good, at the end of the day, the skeptical press is going to say there is no evidence.” Ortel goes on to say, “On the other hand, on charity fraud, it’s a very different thing. In charity fraud, unlike pay-to-play, you don’t have to prove intent.  Under New York State law, in particular, the requirement is merely that you prove the public filings in the Clinton Foundation are false and materially misleading, and they certainly are. This is why you are starting to see these editorial boards around the world say wait a minute.  You also have to prove that they solicited, not that they raised money, that they solicited.  That, the Clintons have admitted. . . . On the charity fraud side of life, that is the mine field for the Clintons.  The second the IRS, or any attorney general or a state taxing authority, decides to make an issue of this, the burden of proof shifts . . .  the charity has to come forward and prove the affirmative case.  The Clinton Foundation has to prove, since October 23, 1997, that all you have been doing exclusively is furthering the authorized tax exempted purposes, which as far as I know is, to be merely a research facility and archive based in Little Rock.  Prove that’s all you have done.  Show us the legally audited financial statements.  Show us those audits.” In closing, Ortel contends, “This is a tale that needs to be told, but it’s not going to be a tale that people swallow at first blush given the fact how powerful the Clintons are or how vengeful the Clintons are when they are in power. . . . Another way to talk about the Clintons is the Bonnie and Clyde of charity or the Al Capone of charity.” Join Greg Hunter as he goes One-on-One with Clinton Foundation researcher, Charles Ortel of CharlesOrtel.com.",1

(AP) — At a press conference early this morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced news of a presidential resignation happening within the next 30 days. “Donald Trump plans to step down as President of the United States and resign from office within the next 30 days,” Ryan told reporters. “Amid the fury of scandals with Russia, the growing criticism from world leaders, the numerous problems his administration and cabinet have had, his lack of care for the environment; Republicans and myself believe this is the best thing to happen, and with some persuasion, Trump has also agreed this was for the best.” News of this comes as Russia’s hacking and involvement into altering the 2016 Election have become clearer. In addition to this, the F.B.I. announced yesterday that they have discovered Russian property holdings which they believe are owned by Trump, gifted to him by Russian President Vladimir Putin in exchange for weaker exportation restrictions. “If the Russian holdings do indeed belong to Trump, this would create a clear conflict of interest and be grounds for immediate impeachment,” Washington Analyst Tom Downey said. “Washington insiders say the Russian holdings are the main reason that Trump is stepping down, hoping to stay ahead of the problem before his name is further dragged through the mud.” Donald Trump took to Twitter, not yet announcing his resignation but hinting at it. “We did great things, the best things, but the FAKE NEWS hates great things! I know you’ll always remember me as the greatest President EVER!” “We think this is the best thing,” Ryan continued. “He has divided this country in more ways than we could have ever imagined. I think Trump meant well, but now it’s time for him to do the right thing and step down and that is exactly what he is doing. Vice President Pence will make an excellent President and I look forward to working with him in the near future.” After word spread of Trump’s impending resignation, Newt Gingerich, who just this week defended Trump for lying, told reporters he is no longer a supporter. “I think I was very clear with all of my actions that I never supported Trump and I plan not to do so in the future as well. I never liked the man, never trusted him. Everyone knows that. Now Mike Pence, he’s the President that we need, a real straight shooter, one of the good guys. I offer my full support and soul to whatever he needs as our new President.” Lloyd Glacier, a spokesman for ‘Sock It Forward‘, a charity started by Donald Trump, that provides homeless men and women with brand new socks, said he agrees with Trump’s plan to resign. “This will give Trump more time to focus on his wife and children, and the other loves of his life, whoever those lucky ladies may be. And just a reminder, a big thank you to everyone that has donated to our cause. 100% of your donation goes directly to clothing the homeless with new socks. Socks, for your information, are the least donated but most needed and requested item at homeless shelters around the country.” 38-year-old Paul Horner, a Christian mascot who goes by the name Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin, said he is sad to see Trump go. “When I’m traveling around the country speaking to Elementary School children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation, I see firsthand the progress that Donald Trump has made in this great Christian nation of ours,” Horner said. “Trump has been on the front lines of this deadly epidemic since day one, working to put an end to self-rape all over the country. He was only months away from signing legislation that would have made masturbation illegal and now it’s all gone.

Former agent, Paul Horner, in his new tell-all book “The Black House,” reveals what goes on inside the White House when the news cameras are turned off. In an interview with CNN, Horner told Victor Berman that he is one-hundred-percent positive that President Obama is not only gay, but a radical Muslim as well. “Everyone on the inside knows that Obama is gay and a Muslim, it is common knowledge,” Horner said. “I saw many men coming and going from Obama’s room, at all hours. I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.” Berman: “In your book you talk about several rituals Obama preformed to unwind from his busy schedule. Can you elaborate on these for our viewers?” Horner: “When no one was around, except his security, Obama couldn’t wait to get out of his suit and into his Muslim tunic. He would wear it while praying to the prophet Muhammad throughout the day. During these prayer sessions he insisted that he not be disturbed.” Berman: “Your book spends a whole chapter devoted to the various “tortures” that Obama and the First Lady would subject you to. Can you explain?” Horner: “Because I was white, Obama would force me to listen to Diana Ross full volume, every day, at all hours of the night. It was horrible, I never got any sleep.

You can’t smell the product,” she said. “It’s too expensive.”And so she, like tens of thousand of other Canadians, went back to their old habits: buying from neighbourhood dealers.Six months after Canada became the first G7 country to legalise marijuana, the bold experiment is still struggling to get off the ground.Legal producers were unable to meet the sudden surge in demand, and struggled for weeks to fill orders, leaving marijuana stores with empty shelves.As a result, the vast majority of cannabis sales in the country – roughly $5bn – are made on the illegal markets, compared to $2bn in legal sales, according government figures from January 2019.Ahead of legalization, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, had argued that the move would nearly eliminate the black market, which he said funnelled money into organized crime.But with so little cannabis to sell, licensed operators across the country have had to turn away potential customers, sending them instead to the black market.“When I’m sold out, they’re still gonna find a product somewhere,” said Trevor Tobin, who operates the High North marijuana store in Labrador with his mother, Brenda.Tobin said running a legal cannabis business has been an “ongoing struggle” in the face of persistent shortages. “It’s hard to keep employees behind the counter when they’re not selling any product – and we lose money every day that we don’t have product on the shelf.”The Tobins are also competing against illegal “grey market” stores, which alongside marijuana sell edibles and hashish – items that licensed stores cannot yet offer.A number of government outlets and licensed private stores have also faced complaints that their products do not match the quality of the black market.“The product I got smelt like barn hay and was just as dry,” wrote one user on the site WeedMaps, reviewing Toronto’s first bricks-and-mortar locations, The Hunny Pot. “The only reason I’ll go back is to get a refund for this purchase.”Melissa agreed: “I found it was really dry. And you feel like you’re getting less as a result. It kind of feels like you’re getting ripped off.” Even her friend, who works at a government store, gets his cannabis from an illegal supplier.Canadians who purchase their cannabis from illegal sources also save a significant amount of money: the average price for a gram of illegal cannabis is 36% cheaper than its legal counterpart, Statistics Canada has found.“As long as that price differential exists, there will likely be a black market – because people will go to where they can get a deal,” said Rosalie Wynoch, a policy analyst at the CD Howe Institute, a conservative thinktank. “The government was aware that it wouldn’t fully displace the black market on day one.” She and others suspect the black market will persist for at least another two years, as it did when Colorado legalised cannabis.Canada is still grappling with how to treat people convicted under the country’s previous laws.The government has promised to pardon 500,000 Canadians with minor cannabis convictions – but the current rules are still not enough, said Murray Rankin of the New Democratic party and member of the parliamentary justice committee.Rankin has become a vocal advocate of expunging the records of those with convictions. “The niceties of the human rights legislation may not be something you’re aware of,” he said. “Even if you were the victim of discrimination, tell me how many people are going to go to the human rights commission with their complaint and deal with it? Frankly not that many.”Rankin also points the uncomfortable reality of policing in Canada: visible minorities are over-represented in the number of minor cannabis convictions.“The disproportionate impact on the hundreds of thousands of Canadians … is something that really should motivate us to not just do the half measure the government’s talked about, but fully expunge so people can get on with their lives,” he said.Canada will begin the second stage of legalization – the sale of edibles and cannabis-infused drinks – in October.",0
"183","https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/04/white-dreams-pure-consciousness/587293/","David Robson","Where do our minds go at night? For more than a century, discussions of dreams have tended to revolve around the interpretation of our dreams’ contents. Do they reflect our unconscious anxieties? Are they an attempt to simulate threats, training us to cope with future challenges? Or are they simply the result of our mental housekeeping, as the sleeping brain reactivates our memories and processes them for long-term storage? In each case, the focus has been on the more immersive, surreal flights of fancy that occupy the sleeping brain.Yet our most puzzling dreams may not have contents at all. Have you ever woken up with the certainty that you had just been dreaming, yet you were unable to recall even a single detail of the scene your mind was playing out? Various sleep studies have found that approximately 30 percent of the time, participants wake up with the sensation that they have been dreaming about something, yet when they are asked to describe the experience, they draw a complete blank. This is a distinct experience from waking up and having no sense of having been dreaming at all, which occurs about 20 percent of the time, or the rich narratives found in the other 50 percent.Sleep researchers refer to that first vague sensation as a “white dream”—and its true nature is a scientific mystery. It’s known that white dreams can occur at any part of the sleep cycle, though they are more likely to occur during non-rapid eye movement, earlier in the night. Sometimes they are explained as a case of simply forgetting what was being dreamed. But some researchers now believe that something much stranger is going on. Rather than reflecting a memory deficit, white dreams might represent a boundary between sleep states, consisting of a basic form of consciousness without detailed sensual content.If so, for a large part of the night, we really are dreaming of nothing. And probing that fundamental state of being might help us understand the foundations of all other conscious experiences.The idea that white dreams are due to some kind of lack of memory dates at least to the time of Sigmund Freud, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In The Interpretation of Dreams, the father of psychoanalysis argued that dreams express our subconscious desires and anxieties, as the brain’s repressive instincts are relaxed. On awakening, however, this “psychic censorship” could come into full force again by blotting out any fantasies that would be too shocking for the conscious mind to handle. Contentless dreams—now known as white dreams—were the result of this repression, Freud said, but he believed they could be recovered through analysis.",0

For the past two years, he has lobbied its members to think of the Anthropocene not as a sudden upheaval, but as a gradual change, a slow transformation of the planet that began 5,000 years ago. “Where could you possibly pick a single start date in this ever-evolving story?” he once asked me in an email.Last week, he and 23 other researchers argued the topic at length in the scientific journal Progress in Physical Geography. At stake is a seemingly simple question: When did human influence over the environment reach a tipping point?For Jan Zalasiewicz, a professor of geography at the University of Leicester, the answer is clear. Zalasiewicz chairs the Anthropocene Working Group, the committee that will soon vote on the existence of the epoch.“If you look at the main parameters of the Earth-system metabolism, then … things only began to change sharply and dramatically with industrialization,” he told me. He believes that the most significant event in humanity’s life on the planet is the Great Acceleration, the period of rapid global industrialization that followed the Second World War. As factories and cars spread across the planet, as the United States and U.S.S.R. prepared for the Cold War, carbon pollution soared. So too did methane pollution, the number of extinctions and invasive species, the degree of surface-level radiation, the quantity of plastic in the ocean, and the amount of rock and soil moved around the planet.It was “the Big Zoom,” he said, borrowing a phrase from the journalist Andrew Revkin. There is “nothing really comparable” to that shift in any other period of Earth history. Even setting carbon pollution aside, he said, the spike in fertilizer use led to the largest jump in surface nitrogen levels in 2.5 billion years. Zalasiewicz hopes the committee will start the Anthropocene in the middle of the 20th century.Ruddiman isn’t so sure. He believes that humanity’s effect on the planet is spread throughout time and is driven primarily by agriculture. Before the year 1750, he argues, humans had already cleared so much forest as to produce 300 billion tons of carbon emissions. Since 1950, deforestation has only led to 75 billion tons of emissions.",0

Unless you are George Baker.The award-winning actor from eastern India is one of just two members of the country’s 545-seat lower house whose name will not appear on any ballot in India’s six-week election season, which kicked off on Thursday.A vestige of India’s colonial history, and a sign of the magnanimous spirit with which the country said goodbye to its British former masters, his is one of two seats in the country’s parliament still reserved for Anglo-Indians: Indian citizens of European descent.“It’s more or less an accepted part of the constitution,” says Baker, whose parents were Greek and migrated to India via Britain shortly before he was born in 1946.Along with another Anglo-Indian, Richard Hay, Baker was appointed to parliament in 2015, where he has the same powers as any MP to vote and spend money on the development of the estimated 150,000 members of his community who remain. Their terms last until 2020.Anglo-Indians are distinct from Indian Christians, who have existed in the country since shortly after Jesus’s reputed death. Nor were they British citizens, who were free to return home after India became independent in 1947.The community who have been called “Midnight’s Orphans” were caught in the middle: descendants of Europeans who had married Indians or else migrated and settled in the country; Christians who spoke English and cultivated British lifestyles but with Indian lineages stretching back hundreds of years, in some cases.Baker, who is best known for his role as a British planter who falls in love with an Indian worker in the 1975 film Chameli Memsaab, speaks four local languages and has married a Hindu woman.“Those Anglo-Indians who have married others in the community try to follow the rule [of living a life that is] 60% British and 40% Indian,” he says from his government apartment in Delhi, within view of the colossal Roman dome of the former Indian viceroy’s residence. “In my case it’s closer to 50/50.”India’s independence was a troubling development for many Anglo-Indians. Their fortunes had ebbed and flowed under colonial rule: first rewarded under the East India Company, then spurned when it was feared they might dominate the colony, as mixed-heritage people had done in parts of South America.After the Indian rebellion of 1857, British colonisers again pulled the Anglo-Indians close, relying on them in disproportionate numbers to run the railway, postal and telegraph networks.An idea to create a separate homeland for Anglo-Indians in the hills of the eastern state of Bihar was dismissed, according to the historian William Dalrymple.Freedom for the subcontinent meant hard choices. “The community could no longer stand on two stools,” wrote Frank Anthony, an Anglo-Indian leader who occupied one of the reserved parliamentary seats for decades.In speeches before independence, Anthony urged his people to throw in their lot with India. “Let us cling and cling, tenaciously, to all that we hold dear, our language, our way of life and our distinctive culture,” he said. “But let us always remember that we are Indians ... The more we love and are loyal to India, the more will India love and be loyal to us.”Anthony failed to convince the British to carve out a special place for Anglo-Indians in the colony’s post-independence government – his book about the community’s struggles would be titled Britain’s Betrayal in India.But India’s first leaders were bighearted. Recognising the community was too diffuse ever to be elected to a parliamentary seat, they reserved two places for them. “They were once part-rulers of this country,” argued one founding father, “and therefore they should be shown some partiality for some time to come.”Yet many still felt out of place. “In the old day there was a mindset that we were between the Britishers and the Indians,” says Bridget White-Kumar, an Anglo-Indian living in the city of Bengaluru. “Sometimes we were not treated well.”“Indians used to have a suspicion of us,” says Baker. “They would think of us as the people who used to carry tales to the Britishers that got them into trouble.“But now so many Dravidians from south India have married Aryans of north India,” he says, in a reference to two of India’s cultural groups. “India is a pleasant potpourri of humanity.”White-Kumar grew up in an Indian mining town that was a “little England”, she says. “Everyone spoke perfect English, we studied in English schools, we ate Kraft cheese and Coleman’s mustard and corn flakes.” In 1956, the Indian government reclaimed the mine from its British owners, marking the end of an era. Like hundreds of thousands of Anglo-Indians, many of the surrounding town’s residents emigrated to the UK, Canada or Australia, where they mostly thrived. The community counts among its ranks the singer Engelbert Humperdinck and the actor Sir Ben Kingsley.Those that remained behind, such as White-Kumar, have gradually become part of the Indian melting pot. “I was born here and I’m a citizen, so I’m Indian,” she says.A hint of defensiveness persists, however. “Contrary to all that has been said to denigrate their origins, the Anglo-India community developed along quite formal and legitimate lines,” says the All India Anglo Indian Association of Delhi, in the opening line of its history of the community.The Anglo-Indian reservation in parliament was supposed to have been phased out by 1960. But successive governments have kept renewing it, even as the Anglo-Indian population is thought to have dwindled (though nobody by how much, as they are not counted separately in the Indian census).One explanation for why it keeps getting renewed is that Anglo-Indians require more help than ever to have their voice heard in parliament. Another, more pragmatic one is that political parties still want the opportunity to install friendly members into parliament, without the hassle of having to get them elected.Baker says he plans to ask the prime minister to renew the reservations again when they expire in 2020. “Gradually we are being integrated, but total assimilation will take a minimum of another 50 years,” he says.In the meantime, their traditions are being kept alive by people such as White-Kumar, who publishes cookbooks of Anglo-Indian cuisine: recipes such as mulligatawny soup, which blend Indian ingredients with British tastes. “We are a bit more judicious in our use of spices,” she explains.",0
"187","https://www.tdtalliance.com/jefferson-davis-statue-replaced-obama-likeness/","anonymous","Workers in New Orleans dismantled the city’s Jefferson Davis monument early Thursday, removing the prominent statue of the Confederate leader that had stood for more than 100 years. As workers slung a strap around the statue’s waist and lifted it off its pedestal, at least 100 people cheered from across the street, outnumbering the few dozen protesters of the removal, some waving Confederate flags. “This historic moment is an opportunity to join together as one city and redefine our future,” Mayor Mitch Landrieu said as he announced that crews had begun removing the statue, the second of four planned removals of Confederacy-related monuments.The Mayor also made an announcement that the statue would be replaced with a bronze statue of the 44th President Barack Obama. “It will be nice”, Landrieu said, “to see a monument to our first African-American President in the same spot that used to be a place to memorialize old racist White privilege.” The Obama statue will be patterned after one erected in Kenya last year and will reportedly cost the Louisana taxpayers an estimated $800,000 dollars. Like an earlier removal, this one was performed in the dark because of death threats against city officials and contractors. Beaureguard Billy-Bob Johnson, one of the leaders of the opposition was outraged by not only the statue being taken down but the fact that it occurred in the middle of the night.“We would have preferred it to be in the daytime,” Johnson said, “so everybody could see what they are doing the light of day. And I really hate coming downtown at night with all the darkies afoot and everything.” Before the monument could be removed, police had to clear the immediate area of demonstrators — both supporters of the monuments and those who want them taken away. Barricades were used to keep the sides separated, NOLA.com reported. The news outlet said chants by monument supporters included “Where’s Mitch?” while opponents chanted, “Hey hey, ho ho, white supremacy has got to go.” As Fox news reported earlier, the mayor’s plan calls for the Davis statue to be melted down and cast into smaller statues of Black Lives Matter leaders",1

I spent a week finding out People had to get by without the search engine giant before it was launched in 1998. But is it possible to live your life – and do your job – without it these days?Halfway through my week without Google, my wife mentions that she would like to go out to see a film that evening, and I agree to deal with the logistics. In what I initially think is an inspired move, I drop by the local cinema on the way home and scribble down all the film times in my notebook. Then my wife insists on going to a different cinema.“Can I do this by phone?” I ask her. “Is 118 still a thing?”Turns out it is, and an expensive one: £2.50 a call, plus 75p a minute, plus a 55p access charge from my mobile provider. But more than a million people a year still use the service, and it even offers a text facility that answers questions – although you’re essentially just asking someone to Google something for you and text you back, for £3.50 a go.Before I started this experiment, when I tried to imagine what it would be like to take a break from Google, what I was really trying to remember was how my life worked all those years before it started.Google was founded in 1998. Thinking back to the mid-90s, I dimly recall visiting libraries in the course of my work as a journalist, and having fat envelopes of press cuttings delivered to my door. I remember tracking down Meat Loaf’s out-of-print autobiography in a secondhand bookshop the day before interviewing him. But often, I never found the answers I was looking for. Instead, I adjusted the questions.I remember factual disputes in pubs and at dinner parties that simply never got settled. I remember finding my own way around town. I remember learning straightforward repairs from books instead of videos. I remember doing all of these things, but I don’t really remember how it felt.To get Google out of your life is a big undertaking. Google Maps doesn’t just get you to places; it drives many of the other apps you use, including Uber. Google owns YouTube. Google controls my thermostat.For the purposes of this experiment, I am simply avoiding the maps, the search engine, the browser and YouTube. I am going to keep using email. There are, of course, other browsers, search engines and map apps out there, but I am not trying to find substitutes. I am trying to do without.My reasons have little to do with Google’s monopoly on searching, or its free and easy way with my data. I am worried it is doing something to my brain. Actually, I am worried that Google is my brain.In his book The Shallows, Nicholas Carr describes familiar symptoms while trying to absorb text of any length: “My concentration starts to drift after a page or two. I get fidgety, lose the thread and begin to look for something else to do.” The book’s main contention is that our highly plastic brains are being rewired by the demands of online existence: an increased knack for mental multitasking comes at the price of our ability to think deeply. Google, he says, is a huge part of this: “Google is, quite literally, in the business of distraction.”The Shallows was published in 2010, and it is unlikely anything has improved since then. Carr maintains that the rise of the smartphone, along with social media, has magnified the problem considerably. “A decade ago, you could still make a distinction between ‘online’ and ‘offline’,” he tells me in an email. “We spent a lot of time on the internet, but we didn’t live there. Now, we do. Today, essentially, people are always online.”Google receives 63,000 searches every second, about 2tn a year, accounting for more than 90% of the global search engine market. It is said that the average person performs three to four searches a day, but a glance through my browser history before shutting Google down shows I regularly exceed 20. Many of these are purposeful; many more are not. Two weeks ago, I found and ordered the precise replacement part I needed for my broken coffee machine. But I also searched for the name of someone I’d met the night before; a definition of China’s One Belt One Road development strategy; a catflap door; a list of Balkan cities (cheating at a crossword); the local recycling timetable; what toothwort is; and “Yul Brynner as robot with face plate removed”.For my own sanity, I need a break.",0

New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat. Where do these horses come from? While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations. Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants  a huge chunk of that business, as well. Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore. Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses. Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.",1

The research by University College London (UCL), which was exclusively shared with the Bureau, also shows that homeless people are much more likely to die from certain conditions than even the poorest people who have a place to live.
The findings come as the final count from our Dying Homeless project shows an average of 11 homeless people a week have died in the UK in the last 18 months. We have been collecting data dating back to October 2017 and telling the stories of those who have died on the streets or in temporary accommodation; our tally now stands at 796 people. Of those people we know the age of, more than a quarter were under 40 when then they died.
While many might assume hypothermia or drug and alcohol overdoses kill the majority of homeless people, this latest research by UCL shows that in fact most homeless people die from illnesses. Nearly a third of the deaths explored by UCL were from treatable illnesses like tuberculosis, pneumonia or gastric ulcers which could potentially have improved with the right medical care.
In February 2018, 48-year old Marcus Adams died in hospital after suffering from tuberculosis. The same year, 21 year old Faiza died in London, reportedly of multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. Just before Christmas in 2017, 48-year-old former soldier Darren Greenfield died from an infection and a stroke in hospital. He had slept rough for years after leaving the army.

Its ancient timber-framed roof and spire had gone up in smoke. But the cathedral stood firm, an imposing, massive presence that Monday’s blaze disfigured but did not destroy.
Parisians were in shock. The spectacular flames had come close to destroying one of their city’s most precious icons and it will take years to restore the building. But the near-catastrophe has reminded a city shaken in recent months by violent social protests of what its citizens have in common: their history.

The worst rain fell in the mountainous central part of Puerto Rico, from the northwest to the southeast. That part of the island is rainy under normal conditions. In an average year, it gets more than 150 inches of rain.
When Maria hit in 2017, it dropped nearly a quarter of that annual rainfall in just one day.
In a paper published Tuesday in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and Sonoma State University in California analyzed rainfall from all 129 hurricanes that have affected Puerto Rico since reliable record keeping began in 1956.
They found that Maria was a behemoth compared with past storms that raked the U.S. territory. The average amount of rain Maria dropped on the island in a day — about 15 inches — was 30 percent more than the previous record set by a tropical storm in 1985, and 66 percent more rain than fell on average during what was previously the largest and costliest storm to ever hit the island, 1998's Hurricane Georges.",0

“What’s good for New Jersey is what’s good for PSEG,” Ralph Izzo, the company’s chairman, president and CEO, told the Legislature at a December 2017 hearing in Trenton. “What’s bad for New Jersey is bad for PSEG.”
And with rock bottom natural gas prices, costly safety upgrades looming and energy usage flat, the outlook for the plants was bleak, he said. Within two years, the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants in South Jersey would be “cash negative” and the company would have to close them, Izzo said.
Hundreds of people would lose their jobs. And the state would lose a source of cleaner energy generation, forcing it to rely more heavily on natural gas. But the Legislature could avert that, Izzo said. To keep the plants open, PSEG would need about $300 million in subsidies over the next three years.
It would be a “safety net” for the company’s nuclear operations in New Jersey, Izzo said. It would not, he emphasized, be “a bailout.”
On Thursday, regulators in New Jersey are scheduled to decide whether PSEG has shown that it needs the subsidies, which would be paid for through a surcharge on all customer bills in the state. If the Board of Public Utilities approves the requests, New Jersey would join two other states, Illinois and New York, in giving nuclear power plants hundreds of millions of dollars in order to stay competitive in the wholesale energy market.
The campaign for the subsidies took to the pages of the state’s largest newspaper, The Star-Ledger, this week. A full-page ad on Monday signed by the employees of the Salem and Hope Creek plants, and another on Tuesday, signed by eight former New Jersey governors, praised the subsidy plan and warned of the consequences of not acting.
“We have seen the devastating impacts to families, communities and the environment as nuclear plants in other states have closed,” the employee ad said. “At the end of the day, we believe that the contributions made by Salem and Hope Creek are much too important to live without.”
The payments are designed to compensate nuclear plants for the clean energy they supply to the state.
“New Jersey has been given an opportunity to preserve its safe, productive nuclear plants,” the former governors wrote. “We would be wise to take it.”
A spokeswoman for PSEG, Marijke Shugrue, said the company had paid for the ads but that the idea to show support for nuclear energy came from the employees and the former governors.",0

"214","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-idUSKBN14I1TY","Richard Cowan and Polina Devitt","U. S. Donald Trump on Friday praised Russian President Vladimir Putin for refraining from retaliation in a dispute over spying and cyber attacks, in another sign that the Republican plans to patch up badly frayed relations with Moscow. Putin earlier on Friday said he would not hit back for the U. S. expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies by President Barack Obama, at least until Trump takes office on Jan. 20. â€Great move on delay (by V. Putin) I always knew he was very smart!â€ Trump wrote on Twitter from Florida, where he is on vacation. Obama on Thursday ordered the expulsion of the Russians and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking political groups in the Nov. 8 U. S. presidential election. â€We will not expel anyone,â€ Putin said in a statement, adding that Russia reserved the right to retaliate. â€Further steps towards the restoration of relations will be built on the basis of the policy which the administration of President D. Trump will carry out,â€ he said. In a separate development, a code associated with the Russian hacking operation dubbed Grizzly Steppe by the Obama administration has been detected within the system of a Vermont electric utility, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing unnamed U. S. officials. The Russians did not actively use the code to disrupt operations of the utility, the officials told the Post, but penetration of the nationâ€™s electrical grid is significant because it represents a potentially serious vulnerability. Trump has repeatedly praised Putin and nominated people seen as friendly toward Moscow to senior administration posts, but it is unclear whether he would seek to roll back Obamaâ€™s actions, which mark a War low in U. S. ties. Trump has brushed aside allegations from the CIA and other intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the cyber attacks.â€ Itâ€™s time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,â€ Trump said on Thursday, though he said he would meet with intelligence officials next week. U. S. intelligence agencies say Russia was behind hacks into Democratic Party organizations and operatives before the presidential election. Moscow denies this. U. S. intelligence officials say the Russian cyber attacks aimed to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russian officials have portrayed the sanctions as a last act of a president and suggested Trump could reverse them when he takes over from Obama, a Democrat. A senior U. S. official on Thursday said that Trump could reverse Obamaâ€™s executive order, but doing so would be inadvisable. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the Obama administration â€a group of embittered and dimwitted foreign policy losers.â€ REPUBLICAN OPPOSITION Should Trump seek to heal the rift with Russia, he might encounter opposition in Congress, including from fellow Republicans. Republican John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said on Friday that Russia must face a penalty for the cyber attacks. â€When you attack a country, itâ€™s an act of war,â€ McCain said in an interview with the Ukrainian TV channel â€1+1â€ while on a visit to Kiev. â€And so we have to make sure that there is a price to pay, so that we can perhaps persuade the Russians to stop these kind of attacks on our very fundamentals of democracy,â€ added McCain, who has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on foreign cyber threats. Other senior Republicans, as well as Democrats, have urged a tough response to Moscow. A total of 96 Russians are expected to leave the United States including expelled diplomats and their families. Trump will find it very difficult to reverse the expulsions and lift the sanctions given that they were based on a unanimous conclusion by U. S. intelligence agencies, said Eugene Rumer, who was the top U. S. intelligence analyst for Russia from 2010 until 2014. But that might not prevent Trump from improving ties to Russia, said Rumer, now director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a policy institute. â€If Mr. Trump wants to start the relationship anew, I donâ€™t think he needs to walk these sanctions back. He can just say this was Obamaâ€™s decision,â€ said Rumer. As part of the sanctions, Obama told Russia to close two compounds in the United States that the administration said were used by Russian personnel for â€ purposes.â€ Convoys of trucks, buses and black sedans with diplomatic license plates left the countryside vacation retreats outside Washington and New York City without fanfare on Friday. A former Russian Foreign Ministry employee told Reuters that the facility in Maryland was a dacha used by diplomatic staff and their children. The complex includes a brick mansion, swimming pool, tennis courts and cottages for embassy staff. Neighbors said the Russians were a lively bunch, seen in summer and known for throwing a large, annual Labor Day party. The Russian consulate in San Francisco said on its Facebook page, â€We hate to have to say goodbye to close to a dozen of our colleagues, our friends.â€ Among those expelled was the consulate chef. Obama had promised consequences after U. S. intelligence officials blamed Russia for hacks intended to influence the 2016 election. Officials accused Putin of personally directing the efforts and primarily targeting Democrats. Washington also put sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies, the GRU and the FSB, four GRU officers and three companies that Obama said â€provided material support to the GRUâ€™s cyber operations.â€ (Additional reporting by Ginger Gibson, Jonathan Landay and Yara Bayoumy in Washington, Yeganeh Torbati and Joel Schectman in Centreville, Md.

"215","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-russia-cyber-compounds-idUSKBN14J1HI","Yeganeh Torbati, Joel Schectman and Emily Flitter","In small convoys of vehicles, Russians departed two countryside vacation retreats outside Washington and New York City without fanfare on Friday, ordered out by U. S. President Barack Obama who said the premises were linked to spying. The Russians were given until noon ET (1700 GMT) on Friday to vacate the compounds in Centreville, Maryland, and in Upper Brookville on Long Island in New York state. By early afternoon, trucks, buses and black sedans with diplomatic license plates had left. â€The premises have been vacated and itâ€™s under control of the government,â€ Elliot Conway, the mayor of Upper Brookville, told reporters soon after noon, when a total of six vehicles had driven away from the Russian compound there. â€Theyâ€™ve been quiet neighbors,â€ Conway said, adding he had never met anyone who lived at the estate set in rolling countryside about 25 miles (40 km) from Manhattan. In Maryland, about a dozen vehicles left the sprawling waterfront estate, watched by officials from the U. S. State Department. Some passengers smiled and waved as they rode away from the compound, which is located in a wooded farm area with winding narrow roads. Obama abruptly ordered the closures on Thursday, saying the compounds had been â€œused by Russian personnel for purposes. â€ It was part of his response, including the expulsion of 35 suspected Russian spies, to what U. S. officials have called cyber interference by Moscow in the 2016 U. S. presidential election campaign. The Kremlin has denied the hacking allegations. The closures echoed the old days of tensions between the United States and the former Soviet Union. When Soviet officials bought compound in Centreville to be used as a country retreat for diplomats posted to Washington, it rattled residents of the bayside Maryland town. It was 1972, in the deep chill of the Cold War. People were suspicious of the Soviets and â€thought they were spies . .. It was the folklore of Centreville,â€ said Joe Dawkins, who works locally in agriculture. The Federal Bureau of Investigation kept an office in Centreville for a time, residents said. The FBI office closed years ago, they said, and over time neighbors in this community of about 4, 500 people got used to officials shopping at the liquor store, hunting nearby and dining at a popular Irish pub, Oâ€™Shucks. The Russian government maintained the compound after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Property records show the Russian government owns an estate on Town Point Lane in Centreville valued at $8 million for tax purposes. The ( ) estate includes a brick mansion, tennis courts and smaller cottages. It sits on the banks of the Corsica and Chester Rivers, where the locals like to fish, harvest oysters and hunt geese. PARTIES AND VODKA Neighbors said the Russians were a lively bunch, seen in summer and known for throwing a large, annual Labor Day party. Each May, to celebrate Russiaâ€™s Victory Day, marking the defeat of the Nazis in World War Two, the compound hosts a soccer tournament for diplomats from former Soviet republics. George Sigler, a Centreville councilman, said he had visited the compound several times for a regatta held jointly by the Russians and a sailing club in nearby Annapolis. There, Sigler said, he socialized with diplomats, including a former Russian ambassador to the United States, Yuri Ushakov. â€œWe were all talking the same language, they were all my age,â€ said Sigler, a former Marine who at one point in his service defended U. S. embassy compounds. â€œAll of us drank way too much vodka. â€ Once, just hours after Sigler admired the quality of the vodka served at the compound, Ushakov had a bottle of it dropped off at the town hall, Sigler said. But mostly, residents said, the Russians appeared to keep to themselves, outsiders in this otherwise town, where many families have roots going back generations. Reverend Joseph Lingan, 59, spent time at a weekend retreat for Jesuit priests next to the Russian compound. He said his foreign neighbors always felt distant when he passed them in town or on the road. â€œPeople here tend to wave to me,â€ he said. He paused and gestured toward the compound. â€œThey donâ€™t tend to wave.â€ A senior U. S. law enforcement official said the U. S. government had long known the compound was used by Russia for intelligence operations, but had not previously seen it as an immediate threat. In Centreville, from the dock of a vacation house he and his wife stay in, Austin Haase, 31, has a clear view of the Russian estate. In summers past, he saw Russians enjoying water sports, Haase said. Haase said he doubted the place was used for intelligence gathering. â€œItâ€™s more a slap in the face (to the Russians) like theyâ€™re taking away their toys,â€ he said. CLAY PIGEON SHOOTING The compound in New York state is set back from the view of the road at the top of a steep hill, accessed by a driveway that curves upwards out of sight. Local resident Nick DeMartino, 23, said he had lived a few houses away for five years and came out to see the departure on Friday. DeMartino said he was used to hearing people in the compound shooting clay pigeons with shotguns on Sundays. â€We knew they were Russian diplomats,â€ he said. â€Weâ€™d see them driving around town.â€ Another neighbor remarked on the abrupt departure. â€Itâ€™s pretty sudden for the government to be stepping in and saying you have to leave here immediately,â€ said Jared Greenman, 28. â€I know in the Cold War there was a chess match of people spying on each other from across the street.â€ Russiaâ€™s ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, accused the Obama administration of targeting Russian diplomatsâ€™ children by closing compounds that he said would be used by families over the Christmas and New Year school vacation. â€œItâ€™s quite scandalous that they chose to go after our kids, you know? They know full well that those two facilities . .. theyâ€™re vacation facilities for our kids. And this is Christmas time,â€ Churkin told reporters when asked about the compounds.

Witnesses described diving under tables as the assailant walked around spraying bullets from an automatic rifle. The attack shook NATO member Turkey as it tries to recover from a failed July coup and a series of deadly bombings in cities including Istanbul and the capital Ankara, some blamed on Islamic State and others claimed by Kurdish militants. Security services had been on alert across Europe for new year celebrations following an attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that killed 12 people. Only days ago, an online message from a State group called for attacks by â€lone wolvesâ€ on â€celebrations, gatherings and clubsâ€. â€At first we thought some men were fighting with each other,â€ said a Lebanese woman who gave her name as Hadeel and who was in the club with her husband and a friend. â€Then we heard the sound of the gunfire and ducked under the tables. â€We heard the guy screaming Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest) all three of us heard that . .. We heard his footsteps crushing the broken glass,â€ she told Reuters. â€We got out through the kitchen, there was blood everywhere and bodies.â€ Officials spoke of a single attacker, a â€lone wolfâ€ in the parlance of Islamic State, but some reports citing witnesses including on social media suggested there may have been several. The incident bore echoes of an attack by militant Islamists on Parisâ€™s Bataclan music hall in November 2015 that, along with assaults on bars and restaurants, killed 130 people. Nationals of Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Lebanon, Libya, Israel, a dual citizen and a woman were among those killed, officials said. Saudi newspaper said five of the dead were from Saudi Arabia. France said three of its citizens were wounded. A massive security operation unfolded to track down the fugitive assailant or assailants and any conspirators. Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said 15 or 16 of those killed at Reina were foreigners but only 21 bodies had so far been identified. He told reporters 69 people were in hospital, four of them in critical condition. Turkey is part of the U. S. coalition against Islamic State and launched an incursion into Syria in August to drive the radical Sunni militants from its borders. It also helped broker a fragile ceasefire in Syria with Russia. â€As a nation, we will fight to the end against not just the armed attacks of terror groups, but also against their economic, political and social attacks,â€ President Tayyip Erdogan said in a written statement. â€They are trying to create chaos, demoralize our people, and destabilize our country . .. We will retain our as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games,â€ he said. Reina is one of Istanbulâ€™s best known nightspots, popular with local high society and foreigners. Some 600 people were thought to be inside when the gunman shot dead a policeman and civilian at the door, forced his way in and then opened fire. Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said the attacker used a â€ weaponâ€ to â€brutally and savagelyâ€ fire on people, apparently referring to some form of assault rifle. U. S. President Barack Obama expressed condolences and directed his team to offer help to the Turkish authorities, the White House said. President Vladimir Putin Putin said Russia remained Turkeyâ€™s reliable partner in fighting terrorism, according to a statement from the Kremlin. â€POLICE MOVED IN QUICKLYâ€ Dozens of ambulances and police vehicles were dispatched to the club in Ortakoy, a neighborhood on the cityâ€™s European side nestled under one of three bridges crossing the Bosphorus and home to nightclubs, restaurants and art galleries. â€I didnâ€™t see who was shooting but heard the gun shots and people fled.

Hurriyet quoted Reinaâ€™s owner, Mehmet Kocarslan, as saying security measures had been taken over the past 10 days after U. S. intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. Turkey faces multiple threats including spillover from the war in Syria. Beside its campaign against Islamic State, it is fighting Kurdish militants in its southeast. The New Yearâ€™s Day attack came five months after a failed military coup, in which more than 240 people were killed, many of them in Istanbul, as rogue soldiers commandeered tanks and fighter jets in a bid to seize power. More than 100, 000 people, including soldiers and police officers, have been sacked or suspended in a subsequent crackdown ordered by Erdogan, raising concern both about civic rights and the effectiveness of Turkeyâ€™s security apparatus. On Dec. 28, the Nashir Media Foundation, which backs Islamic State, urged sympathizers to carry out attacks in Europe during the holiday period and to â€replace their fireworks with explosive belts and devices, and turn their singing and clapping into weeping and wailingâ€. A month ago, a spokesman for Islamic State urged supporters to target â€the secular, apostate Turkish governmentâ€. Turkey has seen repeated attacks in recent weeks. On Dec. 10, two bombs claimed by Kurdish militants exploded outside a soccer stadium in Istanbul, killing 44 people. A car bomb killed at least 13 soldiers and wounded 56 when it ripped through a bus carrying military personnel in the central city of Kayseri a week later, an attack Erdogan also blamed on Kurdish militants. The Russian ambassador to Turkey was shot dead as he gave a speech in Ankara on Dec. 19 by an police officer who shouted â€Donâ€™t forget Aleppoâ€ and â€Allahu Akbarâ€. In June, around 45 people were killed and hundreds wounded as three suspected Islamic State militants carried out a gun and bomb attack on Istanbulâ€™s main Ataturk airport.

As many as 2 million people, surrounded by a ring of sand trucks and some 7, 000 police, gathered in the â€Crossroads of the Worldâ€ to watch the glittering sphere complete its drop, marking the beginning of 2017. With the throng counting down the seconds, the ball slid with smooth precision down its pole, mounted on a tower at the head of the plaza. At the stroke of midnight, it touched home, illuminating a giant â€2017â€ sign and sending a shower of fireworks into the sky. The sights and sounds were experienced by a veritable sea of humanity, sectioned off in block after block of temporary corrals set up to better control the crowd. Millions of others around the world watched the spectacle on television and the internet. Despite the heavy police presence, or perhaps because of it, thousands of people, many from overseas, arrived early to be dazzled by the flashing signage and entertained by live musical performances by Mariah Carey, Thomas Rhett and Gloria Estefan. â€Itâ€™s a very special place, to be in the center of everything tonight,â€ said Marta Loygorra, 20, who came to Times Square from Madrid, Spain, with her father, Jose Loygorra, 54. â€Iâ€™ve always wanted to be here for this and itâ€™s great to be here with my Dad,â€ she said, cuddling up to him for warmth. Jess Smith, 22, of Perth, Australia said that when she booked her New York hotel, she didnâ€™t realize it was just a few blocks north of Times Square. â€Itâ€™s crazy. Itâ€™s crazy good luck,â€ she said with a grin. In the days before the celebration, city and federal officials said they were not aware of any credible threats, and in the event, the party went off without a hitch. But authorities also said they were taking no chances. A protective perimeter of 65 hulking sanitation trucks filled with sand, as well as about 100 other smaller vehicles, encircled the Times Square area. Placed in strategic positions, the â€blockersâ€ are intended to prevent a repetition of the truck attacks in Berlin and Nice earlier this year, officials said. CIRCLE OF TRUCKS It is not the first time that New York has set up a perimeter of heavy trucks at large gatherings. The same strategy helped protect crowds at the Macyâ€™s Thanksgiving Day Parade in November, after Islamic State militants encouraged followers to target the event, which drew about 3. 5 million people. At times since Donald Trumpâ€™s election in November, blocker trucks have been positioned near Trump Tower, his Fifth Avenue headquarters and residence, a short distance from Times Square.

Coast Guard and police vessels patrolled waterways around Manhattan. John Oâ€™Leary, 57, his wife, Claire, 51, and their two children were passing through Times Square on Saturday afternoon during a visit from their native England. â€Itâ€™s just amazing,â€ Oâ€™Leary said. â€I just canâ€™t believe how they can manage all this, in terms of security.â€ U. S. defense and security agencies said they believed the threat of militant attacks inside the United States was low during the New Yearâ€™s holiday, though the possibility of an attack, no matter how remote, was always present, they said. Likewise, New York Police Commissioner James Oâ€™Neill said at a briefing this week that there were â€no direct concernsâ€ related to this yearâ€™s festivities in Times Square. Even so, he said, â€we are going to have one of the events and one of the safest venues in the entire world given all the assets we deploy here.â€ (Additional reporting by Chris Francescani in New York, Ian Simpson in Washington",0

He had gone into hiding since the fatal shooting of Trooper Landon Weaver, 23, of East Freedom, at 6:30 p. m. on Friday.

According to the state judicial database, the suspect had a criminal record dating back at least 10 years. Weaver graduated from the State Police Academy in Hershey in June. He was the 97th state trooper to die in the line of duty since the department was organized in 1905. The last was in late 2014.

Mediators from the Congoâ€™s Catholic church had been heaping pressure on both sides for weeks to sign an agreement aimed at averting a slide into anarchy and possibly another civil war over Kabilaâ€™s decision not to step down despite his mandate expiring more than a week ago. If they stick to it, the agreement will deliver Democratic Republic of Congoâ€™s first peaceful transfer of power since independence from Belgium in 1960. â€Today, we are happy to head up a political compromise,â€ said Marcel Utembi, President of the Catholic Bishops Conference, before representatives of Kabilaâ€™s party, including Mines Minister Martin Kabwelulu and Interior Minister Emmanuel Shadary, and its main opposition alliance, signed the deal. Huge hurdles remain, however. The electoral commission has said elections may not be possible before 2018, and many doubt Kabila really intends to stand down. Several of his supporters have floated the idea of changing the constitution to enable him to run for another term, as other African leaders have done. Any failure to implement the deal would worsen instability that has seen scores of people killed over the past four months, many of them protesters shot dead by security forces. Police and military killed around 40 people last week protesting when Kabilaâ€™s mandate ran out on Dec. 20. â€Now that all pretexts for various plots against the republic have been removed, I call everyone to . .. to create conditions of true peace and stability throughout the country,â€ Kabila said in a address to the nation, which however did not directly address his own view on the talks.

Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar has urged the United Nations to give its blessing to the fragile ceasefire, the third truce this year seeking to end nearly six years of war in Syria. Clashes and air strikes have persisted in some areas since the ceasefire began on Friday, though the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said on Saturday the truce was still largely holding. â€Continued violations by the regime and bombardment and attempts to attack areas under the control of the revolutionary factions will make the agreement null and void,â€ a statement signed by a number of rebel groups said. The statement said government forces and their allies including Lebanese Hezbollah had been trying to press advances, particularly in an area northwest of Damascus in the Wadi Barada valley. The Observatory, which is based in Britain, said government forces and the rebels had clashed on Saturday in Wadi Barada. Rebels say the army is seeking to recapture the area, where a major spring provides most of Damascusâ€™s water supplies. Several people were killed in violence there on Friday, the Observatory said. Blasts from government shellfire were also heard in the southern provinces of Quneitra and Deraa, the Observatory said. Each side blames the other for continued unrest. Russiaâ€™s defence ministry said on Friday rebels had violated the truce 12 times in 24 hours. PEACE TALKS Russia and Turkey, which backs the armed opposition to Assad, brokered the ceasefire agreement in the hope of preparing the way for peace talks in Kazakhstan in the new year. In their statement, the rebels said it appeared the government and the opposition had signed two different versions of the ceasefire deal, one of which was missing â€a number of key and essential points that are â€ but did not say what those were. There has been confusion over which groups in the opposition are included in the ceasefire. Islamic State, which has made enemies of all sides in the conflict, is not included. The Syrian army said on Thursday the militant group formerly known as the Nusra Front was not part of the truce. However, several rebel officials said the group, which has been renamed Jabhat Fateh was also included in the ceasefire deal. (Reporting by John Davison",0

A resolution welcoming the ceasefire, the third truce this year seeking to end nearly six years of war, was adopted unanimously by the Council, meeting in New York. The deal, brokered by Russia and Turkey, which back opposing sides, reduced violence, but firefights, air strikes and shelling went on in some areas. A twin suicide bombing killed at least two people in the Syrian coastal city of Tartous in an area under government control and in President Bashar â€™s coastal heartland shortly after midnight on Sunday, state media and monitors reported. The attack killed at least two security officers and wounded several other people when two suicide bombers blew themselves up after being stopped, Syrian state media reported, in the first targeting of the area for several months. Factions belonging to the Free Syrian Army (FSA) a loose alliance of militias excluding more radical Islamist groups said government forces and Lebanese Hezbollah fighters had been trying to push rebels back in the Wadi Barada valley, northwest of Damascus. â€Continued violations by the regime and bombardment and attempts to attack areas under the control of the revolutionary factions will make the agreement null and void,â€ said a statement from the rebel groups. The rebels and political opposition said the government side was massing forces to launch a ground attack in the area. There has been no new announcement by the military since it launched operations in the area last week. FSA factions said in a separate statement that they would abandon the truce deal if Russia, whose air power has helped President Bashar to turn the tide of the war, did not use its influence to halt the Wadi Barada attacks by 8 p. m. (1800 GMT). Later, two rebel officials said air raids around Wadi Barada had stopped just before 8 p. m. and that the ceasefire therefore still held, although clashes in the area were continuing. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group confirmed that there had been fighting in the area, source of most of the capitalâ€™s water, and said there had also been government shelling in the southern provinces of Quneitra and Deraa. CALL Russiaâ€™s Defence Ministry said on Friday that rebels had violated the truce 12 times in 24 hours. Much of Fridayâ€™s violence took place along the border between Hama and Idlib provinces in northwest Syria. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani agreed in a telephone call on Saturday to work together to try to end the Syria crisis and make a success of peace talks planned for the Kazakh capital Astana, the Kremlin said in a statement. The Observatory said the level of fighting had fallen on Saturday, and the truce was not currently at risk, although one rebel official said it was â€in serious dangerâ€. In their statement, the FSA factions said it appeared the government and opposition had signed two different versions of the ceasefire deal, one of which was missing â€a number of key and essential points that are â€ but did not say what those were. The ceasefire deal is the first not to involve the United States or the United Nations. The Security Council welcomed the truce despite being urged by the FSA factions not to endorse the deal until the Syrian government and Russia had shown they would respect it. The resolution also welcomed plans for the talks in Kazakhstan before a resumption of U. N. talks in Geneva in February. The war has killed more than 300, 000 people and made more than 11 million homeless. Even with a successful truce between Assad and the main armed opposition, the conflict will continue. In particular, Turkey is trying to push back Kurdish forces and the jihadist Islamic State, both excluded from the deal, from areas south of its border. The position of other Islamist groups such as Jabhat Fateh and Ahrar with respect to the ceasefire is unclear",0
"223","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-mosul-idUSKBN14K08Z?il=0","Stephen Kalin","The earth shook three times with the impact of air strikes targeting Islamic State positions north of Mosul. Only then did the Iraqi troops assembled on the edge of the small farming village advance. The army had gathered on Friday afternoon in a muddy street that showed signs of heavy fighting with the jihadists from a day earlier: store fronts shorn off, electricity poles pulled down, bullet casings carpeting the ground. A rooftop sentinel kept watch. The Iraqisâ€™ Humvees, reinforced with steel plates around the wheels to guard against sniper fire, were dwarfed by four MRAPs ( vehicles) manned by U. S. military advisers. The second phase of the operation to retake Mosul, Islamic Stateâ€™s last major stronghold in Iraq, began on Thursday after several weeks of deadlock in the most complex operation in the country since the 2003 U. S. invasion. Conventional U. S. forces deploying more extensively in this phase are now visible very close to the front lines. They are backing Iraqâ€™s army, federal police and service (CTS) whose levels of training and experience vary widely. Since the offensive began 10 weeks ago, CTS punched into Mosul from the east and took a quarter of the city, but regular army troops like those in Sada have made slower progress advancing from the north and south, slowing the operation. MARGINAL ADVANTAGE Western officials from a coalition providing air support, training and advice to the Iraqi military have hailed the recovery of the army and police, which dropped their weapons and fled Islamic Stateâ€™s blitz across a third of the country in 2014 despite billions of dollars in U. S. support. â€They donâ€™t have to be as good as us, they just have to be better than Daesh,â€ one U. S. military official told Reuters earlier this year, using an Arabic acronym for Islamic State. That marginal advantage, though, means the Mosul campaign is likely to drag on for many months and could wreak significant destruction. During earlier battles like the one in Ramadi a year ago, coalition officials said they often had to prod the Iraqis to advance rather than wait for aerial bombardment to eliminate all enemy positions. The Iraqi commanders in Sada huddled with the Americans for a few minutes on Friday, and after the third air strike piled into their vehicles. Half a dozen Humvees charged ahead, firing mounted machine guns and a grenade. As the sound of gunfire pierced the clear blue sky, the U. S. vehicles followed them down the road and appeared to establish overwatch positions in an adjacent field. â€The Americans came this morning. They are for guidance and direction only,â€ said one Iraqi soldier, a bandoleer hanging around his shoulders. â€They donâ€™t enter combat. They will turn and have our backs.â€ Behind the Americans came a dozen more Iraqi Humvees, some of whose occupants fired wildly as they advanced. One soldier standing in the bed of a military truck lost balance and nearly tumbled out when the vehicle lurched forward. Army officers said intelligence suggested about 30 Islamic State fighters were holed up inside the village with two car bombs and a truck bomb and were using tunnels between houses and into agricultural areas to furtively resupply or launch attacks. Inside Sada, reporters saw the bodies of a dozen Islamic State fighters the army said were killed in earlier clashes. A soldier held up the severed head of one, an expression of shock still on its face. (Reporting By Stephen Kalin",0

The televised speech was widely seen as an opportunity for Modi to shore up support after a radical move on Nov. 8 to withdraw all 500 and 1, 000 rupee bills, accounting for 86 percent of currency in circulation. Millions of Indians were forced to queue outside banks for hours to deposit old money and withdraw as much new currency as was permitted, causing widespread anger and raising concerns about Indiaâ€™s economic growth in the current quarter. The â€demonetisationâ€ was designed to crush Indiaâ€™s huge shadow economy, increase tax revenues and promote the use of bank accounts and digital transactions, but perceptions that the ambitious operation was botched have hurt Modiâ€™s standing. It comes only weeks before Uttar Pradesh, Indiaâ€™s most populous state with 200 million people, holds an election that will test whether the popular leader has been significantly weakened. Modi praised Indians for their forbearance. â€In this fight against corruption and black money, it is clear that you would like to walk shoulder to shoulder with us (the government),â€ Modi said. â€For us in government, this is a blessing . .. Corruption, black money, and counterfeit notes had become so rampant in Indiaâ€™s social fabric, that even honest people were brought to their knees.â€ In welcoming news for Modiâ€™s government, State Bank of India ( ) the countryâ€™s largest lender by assets, announced on Sunday it would cut lending rates by 90 basis points, after a surge in deposits in old notes. [L4N1ER03W] Lower lending rates could increase credit growth and spark a revival in private investments. NO â€BIG BANG OFFERINGSâ€ On Saturday Modi had urged banks to do more to increase lending for the poor, while announcing a slew of measures including an offer of a 4 percent discount on interest rates for home loans for up to 900, 000 rupees ($13, 200) taken out in 2017 by middle class Indians. Modi also said the government would increase credit guarantees for small businesses and provided additional incentives for digital transactions. There were steps to help pregnant women and senior citizens, as well as financial support for farmers, an apparent bid to win backing among the huge rural population of Uttar Pradesh that has been hit hard by the cash overhaul. Modi did not say how the government would pay for the measures, although economists said the package was unlikely to be too costly. It was unveiled as the government gears up to announce its annual budget, probably some time in February. â€Itâ€™s clear that Modi is chastened and he had no big bang offerings today,â€ said Mohan Guruswamy, chairman of the independent economic Centre for Policy Alternatives. â€He is clearly doing this to win back political support.â€ The Uttar Pradesh poll will be a litmus test for Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and will go some way to determining the prime ministerâ€™s chances of winning a second term in office in national polls scheduled for 2019. While he has introduced several major reforms to Asiaâ€™s third largest economy, the cash ban is seen as his biggest political gamble to date. Members of the main opposition Congress party were quick to criticize the speech. One senior member, Prithviraj Chavan, said the address was vague and lacked accurate accounting details. â€It was his day to present a report card and specifically disclose the benefits of â€™demonetisationâ€™ but clearly the entire drive has been a failure,â€ he said. In his speech, Modi sought to cast the move as something all Indians should support. â€I urge all parties and leaders to move away from a â€™holier than thou approach,â€™ to come together in prioritizing transparency, and take firm steps to free politics of black money and corruption.â€ ($1=67. 9445 Indian rupees) (Additional reporting by Suvashree Dey Choudhury",0

The announcement by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) late on Saturday comes amid worries that the yuan, which fell nearly 7 percent against the dollar in 2016, could face renewed pressure in the new year as foreign currency buyers start afresh with a new $50, 000 annual quota. Starting Jan. 1, Chinese individuals who want to buy foreign currencies at banks must first fill out an application form specifying the purpose of the purchase, among other information. SAFE will examine such information and data more closely and frequently, according to a statement on SAFEâ€™s website. Previously, Chinaâ€™s reporting system for individual forex purchases was too simple, and outdated, leaving loopholes that facilitated illegal money transfers and SAFE said. For example, some individuals exploited SAFEâ€™s lax management to buy properties and make other investments under capital accounts, using money exchanged under current accounts, according to SAFE. â€Such transactions disrupt normal market order, and erode the interests of those foreign currency buyers who abide by the rules,â€ SAFE said. Individuals caught breaking the rules will be put on a â€watch listâ€ and restricted, or banned from buying foreign currencies â€for a certain period of timeâ€ and the record will be uploaded into their personal systems, SAFE said. Meanwhile, SAFE advised people against buying foreign currencies blindly, arguing that investing overseas could be risky. â€Currently, interest rates in major developed economies are at a low level,â€ SAFE said. â€In addition, the international forex market is volatile, but the yuanâ€™s effective exchange rate is basically stable, and the currency fluctuates sideways against the U. S. dollar. So holding foreign currency assets carries big uncertainty and risks.â€ In 2016, the yuan posted its biggest annual loss against the dollar since 1994, making it the worst performing major Asian currency during the year.

Police chief Franco Gabrielli sent a directive to stations across the country on Friday ordering them to increase efforts to identify and deport migrants a week after Berlin Christmas market attacker Anis Amri was shot dead near Milan. The directive, seen by Reuters, says police should take â€extraordinary actionâ€ before the â€growing migratory pressure in an international context marked by instability and threatsâ€ to â€control and remove irregular foreigners.â€ Interior Minister Marco Minniti plans to open several new detention centers that hold migrants prior to their expulsion, a ministry source said, in line with repeated requests by European Union partners. The tougher migrant stance, which several Italian papers ran on their front pages on Saturday, is the first major policy change made by Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloniâ€™s government since it took power in and comes on the heels of a record year of boat migrant arrivals. It also comes less than a month after the Berlin truck attack by Amri that killed 12, including an Italian woman. The Tunisian Amri came to Italy by boat in 2011. Italy later tried without success to deport him back to Tunisia. He was then released from a detention center and ordered to leave the country in 2015. Gentiloniâ€™s predecessor, Matteo Renzi, agreed to set up â€hotspotsâ€ to identify and fingerprint migrants who arrived on Italian shores, but he refused to build large detention centers to hold migrants who did not qualify refugee status. Only four detention centers with about 360 beds are now functioning. The Interior Ministry is aiming to open up about 16 more with at least 1, 000 more spots, the source said. That would still accommodate only a fraction of migrants without permits of stay estimated to be living in Italy. Of the more than 27, 000 expulsion orders handed out in Italy in 2015, fewer than 5, 000 were deported, according to Eurostat figures. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also called for greater efforts to deport those who do not qualify for international protection, but the process is slow and expensive, and it requires bilateral agreements with the countries of origin. Italy currently has bilateral agreements with only a handful of African countries. (Reporting by Steve Scherer",0

A third blast later in the day killed four people in the eastern New Baghdad district, where a minibus packed with explosives blew up in a busy commercial street, police and medics said. Islamic State has continued to launch attacks in the heavily fortified capital, even after losing most of the northern and western territory it seized in 2014. The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for Islamic Stateâ€™s caliphate, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West. The second phase of a U. S. offensive launched on Thursday following weeks of deadlock has encountered fierce resistance. Conventional U. S. forces deploying more extensively in this phase are now visible very close to the front lines. The third day of the renewed push saw heavy clashes on the southeastern and northern fronts. An army officer deployed in the southeast said there was fierce fighting on the edge of Intisar district on Saturday and advances were slowed by heavy machine gun fire, snipers and rockets attacks by militants entrenched in houses. The officer said Islamic State fighters were firing from houses with white flags raised over the roofs, falsely indicating they are civilians to avoid being targeted by Iraqi forces and coalition airstrikes. â€The more we advance the tougher it becomes. The job of differentiating between fake and real houses with civilians inside is becoming more painful to our troops,â€ he told Reuters by phone. BATTLE FOR MOSUL An elite Interior Ministry unit continued to push on Saturday through the Intisar district, where a U. S. army unit had struggled to advance far after entering the southeast district last month. Heavy gunfire was audible and attack helicopters fired overhead as hundreds of civilians fled their homes, a Reuters cameraman said. In the north, a separate army unit pressed towards the border of Mosul proper after recapturing several outlying villages in the past two days. â€There is a battle in Argoob area, which is considered the gateway to Hadba,â€ Lieutenant Colonel Abbas said by phone, referring to a strategic northern neighborhood. Since the offensive began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of Mosul in the biggest ground operation there since the 2003 U. S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Prime Minister Haider has said the group would be driven out of Iraq by April. Although the militants are vastly outnumbered, they have embedded themselves among Mosul residents, hindering Iraqi forces who are trying to avoid civilian casualties. Despite food and water shortages, most civilians have stayed in their homes rather than fleeing as had been expected. One resident reached by phone late on Friday said a rocket had landed on a house in the eastern Mithaq district, killing six members of one family. â€We have not seen Daesh since the Iraqi forces restarted their offensive,â€ he told Reuters. â€We hear the sounds of large car bombs. Today I heard no fewer than 10 huge explosions.â€ (Reporting by Kareem Raheem and Ahmed Rasheed",0

"232","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-taiwan-usa-idUSKBN14K03S","Ben Blanchard and Benjamin Kang Lim","Chinaâ€™s military has become alarmed by what it sees as U. S. Donald Trumpâ€™s support of Taiwan and is considering strong measures to prevent the island from moving toward independence, sources with ties to senior military officers said. Three sources said one possibility being considered was conducting war games near the island that China considers as a breakaway province. Another was a series of economic measures to cripple Taiwan. It was not clear whether any decisions had been taken, but the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Taiwan issue had become a hot topic within the upper echelons of Chinaâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) in recent weeks. Trump, due to take office on Jan 20, angered Beijing this month by speaking to Taiwanâ€™s president by telephone, breaking decades of precedent and casting doubt on his incoming administrationâ€™s commitment to Beijingâ€™s â€one Chinaâ€ policy. Beijing fears this could embolden supporters of independence in Taiwan. â€If Trump challenges â€™one Chinaâ€™ after becoming president, this would cross our red line,â€ said another source, who has ties to Chinaâ€™s leadership. Chinaâ€™s defense ministry declined to comment. An official at the ministryâ€™s news department said Chinaâ€™s position was clearly laid out in the 2005 Law, which authorizes the use of force against Taiwan in the event China judges it to have seceded. Asked about any possible aggressive moves from China, Taiwan defense ministry spokesman Chen said: â€We are fully prepared, and plan for the worst while preparing for the best.â€ China claims Taiwan as its sacred and inviolable territory and is deeply suspicious of President Tsai whose ruling Democratic Progressive Party espouses the islandâ€™s independence. Tsai, who took power this year, says she wants to maintain peace with China, but China is unconvinced. Tsai said on Saturday that Taiwan will be â€calmâ€ when facing issues to do with China, but uncertainties next year will test the island and its national security team. Beijing has also been angered by a trip planned by Tsai in January to Latin America in which she will transit through Houston and San Francisco. China has urged the United States to block the stopovers. Chinese officials have blamed Taiwan for creating trouble rather than Trump, and many of them believe he will be more accommodating to China once in office. â€Weâ€™re ready. If Taiwan wants to make trouble so can we. Letâ€™s hit them hard,â€ said an official in Beijing who meets regularly with Chinaâ€™s most senior military officers, including those who work directly with President Xi Jinping. â€We can hold exercises close to Taiwan, and show them the damage we could cause. Taiwan will have to give in then,â€ the official added, citing a recent conversation with one of the military officers. ONE CHINA POLICY The United States is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but itâ€™s unclear if the United States would send troops in the event of war between China and Taiwan. Washington also acknowledges Beijingâ€™s position that there is only one China and Taiwan is its territory. A retired senior officer who maintains contacts with the PLA told Reuters that China probably wouldnâ€™t need to fire any missiles to bring Taiwan to its knees. China is Taiwanâ€™s largest trading partner, and Taiwan runs a huge trade surplus with China, worth $27 billion in 2015. â€We can just cut them off economically. No more direct flights, no more trade. Nothing. Taiwan would not last long,â€ the officer said. â€There would be no need for war.â€ In addition, any Western economic blockade of China put in place in the event of war with Taiwan would also be damaging to China, already dealing with a slowing economy. A U. S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Chinese actions had been more provocative in the past month, since Trump won the U. S. election and made comments about Taiwan. This month, a Chinese naval flotilla headed by its sole aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, took part in drills that took it around Taiwan. Chinese air force jets have performed similar drills in recent weeks, flying close to the island, though China has officially called the air force and naval exercises routine. China also scored a diplomatic victory when tiny Sao Tome and Principe switched recognition to Beijing from Taiwan. (Additional reporting by J. R.

Baker, Heather Somerville and Lauren Hirsch","But more than a dozen expected stock offerings of relatively obscure software firms targeting business customers names such as Apttus, Tintri and Okta could be just as important in thawing a IPO market, according to investment bankers and advisers who work on IPOs. Such firms are a â€leading indicatorâ€ of broader investor demand for market debuts, said Justin Smolkin, head of Americas technology equity capital markets at UBS Group AG ( ). â€They tend to be viewed as cream of the crop, and where investors make the most money,â€ he said. Such enterprise software companies generally sell their services through subscriptions that produce reliable revenue streams. They aim to sign contracts lasting several years, giving investors more predictable returns than many Internet or companies that depend on advertising or high volumes of individual transactions. The firms provide a range of services, such as automating business processes, security, accounting, training software and expense management. Although such companies have moderate valuations, between about $500 million and $4 billion, the sector accounts for most of the tech IPO market, said Will Connolly, Goldman Sachs Group Incâ€™s ( ) head of U. S. technology equity capital markets. â€Most of the technology IPO activity is actually not big, companies going public,â€ Connolly said. â€Itâ€™s small and midcap growth companies going public that are innovators in their own markets and are helping drive the next generation of technology.â€ Reuters has identified more than a dozen U. S. enterprise software companies that are making preparations for a 2017 IPO including Avalara, MuleSoft, ForeScout Technologies Inc, AppDynamics and Yext. [L1N1EO00X] In 2016, only six software companies went public, Thomson Reuters data showed. For a graphic showing software IPO trends over the past two decades, see Greg Becker, chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank, a lender to venture companies, predicted that between 30 to 45 venture technology companies could go public in 2017, compared to 15 in 2016. These companies could also be aiming to get ahead of tech giants Airbnb Inc and Uber Technologies Inc, whose IPOs would require ample investor dollars and attention. If the enterprise software firmsâ€™ IPOs succeed, it could offer a boost to investors who provided key funding in the hopes of profiting by selling shares down the line. Only 20 technology companies went public in 2016, less than any year since 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. â€It will be important for everyone that these deals work well in the market to create positive momentum for the year,â€ said Anthony Kontoleon, global head of syndicate in the equity capital markets group of Credit Suisse Group AG ( ). If technology IPOs donâ€™t take off in 2017, some venture capital fund managers could struggle to keep their investors happy. Startups that have attracted and retained talented employees with the promise of a lucrative IPO could also suffer. The handful of technology companies that managed to go public near the end of 2016 have shown strong stock performances. Twilio Inc ( ) Coupa Software Inc ( ) Nutanix Inc ( ) and Blackline Inc ( ) are now trading above their offer prices, boosting the confidence of their private peers that there is demand for such IPOs. The recent stock market rally and companies beginning to accept a more modest pricing of offerings for IPOs has more tech companies ready to test the waters. Many had put IPO plans on hold in 2016 because they did not want to go public at lower valuations than the private fundraising rounds preceding them. Enterprise software companies recognize that an IPO could be a major marketing event that gives them clout with potential customers that are publicly traded companies themselves and conduct extensive due diligence before choosing a software vendor. â€The greatest benefit of an IPO is the transparency it creates. It comes with a much greater sense of legitimacy,â€ said Rob Bernshteyn, chief executive of Coupa Software ( ) a spend management tech company that went public in October. Dheeraj Pandey, chief executive of Nutanix ( ) said he believes the companyâ€™s IPO in 2016 won the hybrid cloud software maker new enterprise customers. â€œCustomers want to know youâ€™re going to be around for a long time,â€ Pandey said. Similar firms now looking to go public realize they have a marketing challenge ahead as they seek to capture investor interest before their market debuts. With names that trip up a spell checker and arcane descriptions, they need to educate investors on their niche strategies and to start those efforts long before the typical investor road shows that precede IPOs. Apttus, for example, helps salespeople give a price quote quickly when trying to close a complicated deal that includes different products. The company has already briefed many potential IPO investors in earlier funding rounds, said chief executive officer Kirk Krappe. â€Those investor meetings, and our relationship with Morgan Stanley ( ) have helped put us on the map,â€ Krappe said.

Oil prices have slumped since the summer of 2014 from above $100 a barrel. The price rout, due to an oversupply thanks in part to the U.

Donald Trump have appropriated the phrase â€basket of deplorablesâ€ used by Hillary Clinton during the campaign to pillory some of his backers to plan an inauguration party called the â€Deploraball.â€ But while the intention might be to mock the defeated Democratic candidate, the planned gathering has revealed a deep schism within the ranks of a movement known as the : pitting those embracing white nationalism or outright racism against those seeking a more credible platform for conservatives. The party will be held at the National Press Club in Washington the night before Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, when many official inauguration events are taking place. Organizers say the Deploraball is a cocktail party for Trump supporters from all ethnic backgrounds and no incendiary or discriminatory actions will be allowed. Organizers call themselves â€Trumpistsâ€ and say they have sold 1, 000 tickets ranging in price from $99 to $2, 500. But after an online battle between star guests, Deploraball organizers offered ticket holders refunds â€in light of recent events.â€ One of the original organizers of the ball, social media personality Tim Treadstone who is commonly referred to by his online persona â€Baked Alaska,â€ has been disinvited after tweeting several comments, setting off angry exchanges among members of the on Twitter. Another featured guest at the party, Mike Cernovich, has condemned Treadstone for appearing and homophobic. â€The lines are drawn and the fracture is more or less complete,â€ he said. Cernovich, an architect of viral Internet trends promoting rumors of Clintonâ€™s supposed ill health that have been credited with helping push Trump to victory with the support of the said he has rejected the â€™s descent into white nationalism. The movement, which came to the fore during the presidential campaign, is a loose grouping that rejects mainstream politics and includes white supremacists and . It had previously been more widely embraced by libertarians and the fringe: people more opposed to the concept of political correctness than to racial or other diversity. Trump has been criticized for naming Steve Bannon, former head of the Breitbart News website that is closely linked to the as a senior White House adviser. Days after the Nov. 8 election, the movement was strongly criticized when some Trump supporters gave Nazi salutes to leader Richard Spencer, president of the National Policy Institute, during a gathering in Washington to celebrate Trumpâ€™s victory. The incident prompted some figures linked with the to assume the term â€new rightâ€ to describe themselves instead. In an interview with New York Times journalists last month, Trump condemned the conference organized by Spencer. â€I condemn them. I disavow, and I condemn,â€ Trump said. â€™NO NAZI SALUTESâ€™ After Treadstone posted tweets over the past week, Cernovich told him not to repeat the â€hailgateâ€ scandal at Deploraball. â€No Nazi salutes . .. or donâ€™t have your name on the event,â€ Cernovich wrote in a series of text messages to Treadstone that were later posted on Twitter. The argument raged on social media between the two southern men, who were once friends, egged on by their fans. â€You used the movement and now you want to distance yourself from it,â€ Treadstone, wearing camouflage apparel and a bleached blond beard, said in one video post. The Republican Trump, has not been formally invited to the event nor is he expected to attend, but â€of course weâ€™d be thrilled if he did,â€ said one organizer, Jeff Giesea. Trumpâ€™s transition team was not immediately available for comment on the party. In remarks she quickly said she regretted, Clinton told a fundraiser in September that Trump had given voice to hateful rhetoric through his behavior as a candidate and that â€halfâ€ of his supporters belonged in a â€basket of deplorables.â€ Trump supporters seized on the phrase as typifying snobbish by coastal elites. The Deploraball was initially planned for the Clarendon Ballroom in Arlington, Virginia, but organizers said the venue was switched because of pressure on the Clarendon from Clinton supporters. The Clarendon, a private events venue and nightclub, denied that and said in a statement it decided not to issue a contract â€due to the suspicious actions of the organizers.â€ Performers will include singer Scott Isbell and classical pianist Stephen Limbaugh, according to the organizers, who have also invited rapper Kanye West but have not heard back. Treadstone, a former rapper and orchestrator of had also been scheduled to perform. BREITBART TECH EDITOR Another guest star will be Breitbartâ€™s U. S. technology editor, Milo Yiannopoulos, organizers say. Yiannopoulos has been criticized for comments he has made about Muslims, Black Lives Matter activists and feminists. Twitter banned him in July for inciting harassment of the actress Leslie Jones. The Hollywood Reporter reported on Thursday he had secured a book deal and quoted him as saying, â€They said banning me from Twitter would finish me off. Just as I predicted, the opposite has happened.â€ ( ) Treadstone said the main difference between himself and the new right, including Cernovich and Yiannopoulos, is the explicit support of white nationalism. â€If you donâ€™t support white advocacy, you cannot be and thatâ€™s where a lot of people are running into a problem,â€ he told Reuters. Cernovich, who says Treadstone is increasingly fixated on Jewish conspiracy theory, said the branch of former he belongs to are more inclusive and are primarily focused on populism, nationalism and the rejection of â€victim culture and identity politics.â€ The group also has no clear leader, unlike with white nationalist which looks to Spencer, he said.

North Korea tested ballistic missiles at an unprecedented rate during 2016, although some experts have said it is years away from developing an ICBM fitted with a nuclear warhead capable of reaching the United States. â€Research and development of cutting edge arms equipment is actively progressing and ICBM rocket test launch preparation is in its last stage,â€ Kim said during a televised New Yearâ€™s Day speech. The country has been under U. N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. The sanctions were tightened last month after Pyongyang conducted its fifth and largest nuclear test on Sept. 9. A successful ICBM test launch would mark a significant step forward for secretive Pyongyangâ€™s weapons capability. ICBMs have a minimum range of about 5, 500 km (3, 418 miles) but some are designed to travel 10, 000 km (6, 214 miles) or further. California is roughly 9, 000 km (5, 592 miles) from North Korea. However, North Korea has struggled to reliably deploy its Musudan ballistic missile, succeeding just once in eight attempted launches last year. U. S. State Department spokeswoman Anna on Sunday called on North Korea â€to refrain from provocative actions and inflammatory rhetoric that threaten international peace and stability, and to make the strategic choice to fulfil its international obligations and commitments and return to serious talks.â€ She urged â€All states to use every available channel and means of influence to make clear to the DPRK and its enablers that launches using ballistic missile technology are unacceptable, and take steps to show there are consequences to the DPRKâ€™s unlawful conduct.â€ The Musudan is designed to fly about 3, 000 km (1, 860 miles) posing a threat to South Korea and Japan, and possibly the U. S. territory of Guam. South Koreaâ€™s Defence Ministry declined to comment on whether North Korea would test launch an ICBM soon. TRUMP REQUESTED NORTH KOREA BRIEFING According to a senior U. S. intelligence official, Donald Trumpâ€™s first, and at that time only, request for a special classified intelligence briefing was for one on North Korea and its nuclear weapons programme. North Korea and its nuclear programme has also been of interest to retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, Trumpâ€™s choice for national security advisor and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. An a former North Korean military officer who defected to the South and runs a think tank in Seoul, said Kim will gauge Trumpâ€™s comments about his country for potential interest in dialogue and determine whether to try and conduct an ICBM test launch. â€If Trump comes in and the North does not get a good signal in terms of how the relationship between the two countries is going to go, thatâ€™ll give them another reason to do it,â€ An said. Kim also said that the North would continue to develop its nuclear strike capability if the United States and South Korea continue to conduct annual joint military exercises. There are 28, 500 U. S. troops based in South Korea, and North Korean state media often describes annual joint exercises as preparation for an attack. In February, North Korea launched a satellite into space, which was widely seen as a test of ballistic missile technology. A senior U. S. military official said last month that North Korea appears able to mount a miniaturised nuclear warhead on a missile but is still struggling with missile technology necessary for longer range strikes. Although it fired a variety of missile types last year, North Korea is not known to have a ballistic missile since October. (Reporting by Tony Munroe, Jack Kim and Nataly Pak",0

RISING COMPETITION Hyundai Motor likely clocked its fourth straight annual profit decline in 2016. Sales were hit by its which meant it missed a boom in SUV demand, and sluggish emerging markets. Hyundai Motor sold 4. 86 million vehicles compared with its target of 5. 01 million last year. Kia Motors sold 3. 02 million vehicles, shy of its goal of 3. 12 million. Hyundai Motor is now targeting 2017 global sales of 5. 08 million vehicles, while its smaller affiliate set its goal at 3. 17 million vehicles. Kia Motors Vice Chairman Lee warned of tough competition in the year ahead. â€Rivals are expected to launch a assault based on their cost competitiveness,â€ he said in a speech to employees. Hyundai Motor shares ended up 2. 7 percent on Monday and Kia Motors stocks were up 0. 6 percent in a flat wider market . Hyundai Motor shares fell for a third straight year in 2016, down 2 percent, while Kia Motors was the stock among major car makers with a 25 percent slump. Executives paid the price for Hyundai Motorâ€™s rough year. The automakerâ€™s top U. S. executive resigned and the South Korea sales chief and China head were replaced.

The worldâ€™s monarch, who became unwell before Christmas, stayed indoors at her Sandringham country estate in Norfolk, eastern England, while other members of the royal family attended the service. â€The Queen does not yet feel ready to attend church as she is still recuperating from a heavy cold,â€ Buckingham Palace said in a statement. Elizabeth and her husband Prince Philip, 95, were both suffering from heavy colds in the week leading up to Christmas and delayed their journey from London to Sandringham by a day, traveling there by helicopter on Dec. 22. Philip attended both the Christmas and New Year services. On Sunday he arrived by car before walking into the grey stone parish church of St. Mary Magdalene, but the queen, who is the symbolic head of the Church of England, made no public appearance. A few dozen parishioners and a crowd of photographers had gathered outside the church on Sunday morning in cold, rainy weather as other members of the royal family arrived. The queenâ€™s daughter, Anne, and her third son, Edward, were among those who attended. Elizabeth had previously attended the Christmas service at the church every year since the royal family started celebrating Christmas at Sandringham in 1988. After more than six decades on the throne, the queen has cut back on international tours but still regularly performs official duties around Britain. The palace announced on Dec. 20 she would step down as patron of several charities and other organizations to reduce her workload. While Elizabethâ€™s father, King George VI, died at the relatively young age of 56, her mother, known as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, lived until 101 and was still appearing in public almost up until her death in 2002. Elizabeth has maintained the popularity of the monarchy despite years of political, social and cultural change since she became queen on Feb. 6, 1952, aged just 25.

The truce deal, brokered by Russia and Turkey which back opposing sides in the conflict and welcomed unanimously by the United Nations Security Council, has been repeatedly violated since it began, with warring sides trading the blame. Rebels on Saturday warned they would abandon the truce if the government side continued to violate it, asking the Russians, who support President Bashar to rein in army and militia attacks in the valley by 8:00 p. m. Bombardments ceased before that time although some clashes continued but began again late on Sunday. It was not immediately clear if the rebels would abandon the truce as a result. Like previous Syria ceasefire deals it has been shaky from the start with repeated outbreaks of violence in some areas, but has largely held elsewhere. The raids hit areas of Wadi Barada, where government forces and their allies launched an operation more than a week ago, a spokesman for the Jaish rebel group and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. There was a â€fierce attack and attempt by Assad and Shiâ€™ite militias to raid Wadi Baradaâ€ from nearby hills, the rebel spokesman, Mohammed Rasheed, said. State media and the Observatory said hundreds of people had left Wadi Barada in the past day for areas nearby. Earlier on Sunday government warplanes carried out several air strikes in the southern Aleppo countryside, the Observatory and rebel officials said. Government forces also advanced overnight against rebels in the Eastern Ghouta area near Damascus, seizing 10 farms, the Observatory said. A second rebel official suggested that clashes on the ground would not necessarily derail the truce, but that air strikes were a â€clear violationâ€. Russiaâ€™s defence ministry has accused the insurgents in turn of violating the ceasefire numerous times. A military news outlet run by Lebanese group Hezbollah, an ally of Assad, said the Syrian army had been targeting militants from the former Nusra Front both in southern Aleppo province and in Wadi Barada. The army has said the group, previously al Qaedaâ€™s Syria branch, is not included in the ceasefire deal but rebels say it is just one point of friction and confusion in the deal which could lead to its collapse. The latest truce agreement is the first not to involve the United States or the United Nations a reflection of Moscowâ€™s growing diplomatic influence after a long campaign of Russian air strikes helped Assad recapture the northern city of Aleppo last month. That victory has greatly strengthened the presidentâ€™s position as the warring sides prepare for peace talks in the Kazakh capital Astana this month. (Reporting by John Davison",0
"243","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-attack-idUSKBN14L0X3?il=0","Isabel Coles and Ali al-Rubaie","Islamic State attacked an Iraqi police checkpoint near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday, killing seven policemen as government forces in the north made more gains against the militants in Mosul, their last major stronghold in the country. The Najaf attack, which involved gunmen and a suicide car bomb, followed blasts a day earlier in Baghdad that left 29 people dead, a reminder of Islamic Stateâ€™s continued ability to operate away from territory under its control. The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for the groupâ€™s caliphate in the areas it seized in 2014, but the militants would still be capable of fighting a insurgency in Iraq, and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West. Since the U. S. offensive began on Oct. 17, elite forces have retaken a quarter of Mosul in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 U. S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Prime Minister Haider has said the group would be driven out of the country by April. The second phase of the campaign launched on Thursday following weeks of deadlock has pushed Islamic State out of several more areas despite fierce resistance. The fourth day of the renewed push saw incremental advances on the eastern and southeastern fronts. A military statement said the forces had retaken part of Karama district. A federal police officer said Iraqi forces had taken near total control of Intisar and Siha neighbourhoods, and were clearing Salam. â€For the fourth day in a row, federal police units supported by the army are on the offensive,â€ he told Reuters at a forward base in Intisar. An artillery strike on Sunday by the U. S. coalition supporting the Iraqi forces struck a mortar position next to two empty school buildings in eastern Mosul. A U. S. military statement said no civilians were in the area and minimal damage was reported to the buildings, which like hospitals and mosques, are protected under international law. â€While the Coalition takes extraordinary effort to protect civilians and strike appropriate military targets, we will continue to strike ISIL wherever and whenever our partnerâ€™s lives are in danger in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict,â€ it said, using an acronym for Islamic State. FLEEING CIVILIANS The attack near Najaf, 500 km (310 mile) south of Mosul, happened when two vehicles travelling through the desert were stopped at a police checkpoint around town, local police sources said. The driver detonated an explosive load and the second vehicle fled. Police pursued it and killed the two militants inside. In a statement distributed online by supporters, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, which also wounded 17 people including civilians. It said four gunmen had opened fire before detonating explosive vests and then a fifth assailant launched a suicide car bomb. It was not immediately possible to reconcile those accounts. Although the militants are vastly outnumbered in Mosul, they have embedded themselves among residents, hindering Iraqi forces who are trying to avoid civilian casualties. Despite food and water shortages, most civilians have stayed in their homes rather than fleeing as had been expected. Thousands more people have fled their homes since the militaryâ€™s new push began, many under the cover of darkness to avoid detection by Islamic State. Families leaving Mithaq district on Sunday had to climb over earthen berms the military has built across roads to block car bombs. One resident reached by phone in eastern Mosul said he had never seen such heavy bombardment. Several civilians were wounded when a mortar fell in his street, but they could not be ferried to the hospital on the western side of the city because air strikes have taken all the bridges out of service. â€One of them is my friend. His stomach is bleeding badly. We found a doctor in the neighbourhood to treat him but I fear he will die if he stays like this for long,â€ he said. A resident of Karama district said Islamic State had begun forcing residents out of some areas, burning the cars of residents who refused to move. â€They want to clear out the neighbourhood before the Iraqi forces enter,â€ he said.

Cameron Sterling, the son of Alton Sterling, whose death at the hands of police was caught on video, spoke about his father and protests. Alton Sterling was killed by Baton Rouge police on 5 July at a convenience store, where he was said to be selling CDs. Baton Rouge police said in a statement that police were called to the convenience store because Sterling had allegedly threatened another patron with a gun. The press conference on Wednesday is Cameronâ€™s first since he broke into sobs at a nationally broadcast press conference with his mother, following his fatherâ€™s death. â€œI came to talk to everyone about one: the death of my father. And, two: about how I feel about people in general,â€ said Cameron, whose distinctly young voice was calm and composed in front of the scrum of reporters at the Triple S convenience store. â€œPeople, in general, no matter what the race, should come together as one united family. â€œNo more arguments, violence, crimes,â€ said Cameron. â€œYes, you can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way. Protest in peace â€” no guns, no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. Everyone needs to protest in the right way, with peace. No violence, none whatsoever. â€ Earlier on Wednesday, in an interview with CBS News, Cameron said he didnâ€™t believe all police were â€œbadâ€ and that all police â€œshouldnâ€™t be punished for other policeâ€™s crimesâ€. â€œThe police in Dallas, Texas, they didnâ€™t deserve that,â€ said Cameron. Alton Sterlingâ€™s death spurred a Department of Justice investigation, protests across the country, and was one of the subjects of a march in Dallas on Thursday when a gunman attacked and killed five police officers there. His was the first of two police shootings that week, including a shocking video of the shooting of Minnesota man Philandro Castile, the aftermath of which was broadcast live on Facebook by his girlfriend.",0

Christieâ€™s said they were sold as separate lots on Wednesday but were all bought by an anonymous private American collector. The Â£2, 479, 000 sale in London included the bardâ€™s first folio, which is widely considered to be the most important literary publication in the English language. The book, published in 1623, contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not appeared in print before. It fetched Â£1. 87m, well above its estimate of between Â£800, 000 and Â£1. 2m. Christieâ€™s book expert Margaret Ford said it was â€œexhilaratingâ€ to bring the newly recorded book to the publicâ€™s attention on the 400th anniversary of the playwrightâ€™s death. It was sold along with later editions published in 1632, 1664 and 1685. Ford said: â€œWe are pleased with the results achieved in the sale especially since all four books were acquired by the same private American collector. The universality and timelessness of Shakespeareâ€™s insight into human nature continues to engage and enthral audiences the world over. â€œEven four centuries after his death, his plays touch and transform lives and continue to be read and performed from Albania to Zambia. â€",0
"246","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/31/grandmothers-death-saved-me-life-of-debt","Robert Pendry","Debt: $20, 000, Source: College, credit cards, Estimated time till debt free: Unclear, From a purely financial standpoint, my grandmotherâ€™s death is probably the best thing that has happened to me in my adult life. My grandmother came from overseas to live with my mother and me when I was in high school, as the ravages of Alzheimerâ€™s left her unable to care for herself. This was a difficult situation for everyone and money became tight. But I did enjoy getting to spend time with my grandmother, who I seldom got to visit while growing up. Some of the fondest memories I have of her are from this time. We would sit together on the sofa and watch her favorite television show â€” Jeopardy! â€” even if she wasnâ€™t exactly sure who I was. I did well in high school and chose to attend a prestigious (and expensive) private university, far away from home. I had won some scholarship money for my academic merits. Although the amount of debt I would have after graduating was apparent up front, I did not fully understand it. That large figure seemed so abstract at the time, and I refused to let it dampen my excitement about going to college. I set out to earn more than one degree, which cost me more money. Significant surcharges were added to my tuition for taking excessive credit hours, and even larger fees were incurred when enrolling in summer classes I had to take in order to keep up. Thus the waters of debt started to flood higher than they were supposed to. I delivered pizzas, worked at the library, tutored and worked an array of other jobs. This did nothing to abate these rising floodwaters, although the extra money did help me manage the several credit card accounts I was forced to open during this time to pay for food, gas, rent and utilities. I graduated in 4. 5 years with two bachelor of science degrees and two minors, along with nearly a quarter of a million dollars in cumulative debt, mostly from student loans. I wouldnâ€™t change any part of my journey. I met some amazing, lifelong friends in college. I received a education from truly inspirational professors. And I had the opportunity to work in a laboratory and contribute to meaningful scientific research studying Alzheimerâ€™s disease. I strongly desired to go to graduate school. I wanted to pursue scientific research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, this was unfeasible in light of my debt. Graduate students do not typically earn attractive incomes. It was around this time that my grandmother passed due to complications following her long struggle with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. To be sure it was a sad event, as it always is when a loved one dies. But my grandmother had become chronically bedridden, a frail shell of a human being, unable even to recognize her own daughter â€” my mother â€” toward the end. The coming of death was, I think, a merciful one: it seems that we should pity the living, not the dead. After it happened, my mother looked as though a weight had fallen off her shoulders. She wasnâ€™t the only one whose burden would be lessened by the loss. After her death, my grandmotherâ€™s finances, assets and properties were entrusted to my mother. She liquidated nearly all of it, deciding that the best way of putting it to use was by helping me repay my student loan debt. This was a massive relief from a suffocating situation. My remaining $20, 000 in credit card debt is manageable, although I do not know when I will be completely free of it. I shudder to think of how my situation would be were it not for my grandmotherâ€™s â€œcontributionâ€. I now work three jobs â€” one and two â€” in order to manage the remaining debt, along with the expense of living in a major metropolitan area. Despite my two degrees and prior work in scientific research, I earn just above minimum wage working in a laboratory at a dollar biomedical research institution. The pay could be better, but I consider myself very fortunate to still be able to work doing scientific research related to neurodegenerative diseases, a field I remain passionate about for obvious reasons. Which is all a bit ironic considering that Alzheimerâ€™s disease is, indirectly, the only reason Iâ€™m not utterly drowning right now.",0
"247","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/26/cancer-diagnosis-existential-life-accomplishments-meaning","Bradford Frost","It was late. I was drunk, nearing my 35th birthday this past May, alone in a dank college dorm room, attending my grad school reunion. The journal entry I wrote that night was just one line: â€œIâ€™m not the man I want to be. â€ As reunion charades go, nothing about my life actually suggested I was off track. I had ambitious public service aspirations worked tenaciously loved fiercely wrote confidently about equal opportunity and the American dream bought into and unabashedly endorsed my adopted hometown of Detroit as the best place in the country to work with meaning and purpose. Iâ€™d published a book. Iâ€™d supported my wife through cancer, relapse, and now four years of remission. I even ran a marathon. But my journal admission reflected two longstanding personal challenges. First, despite all my accomplishments, I carried a deeply held internal anxiety about being â€œgood enoughâ€ to meet my ambitions. Second, I believed my alcohol abuse posed a serious threat to it all. Combined, they exposed my biggest fear: was my life of meaning and purpose as I envisioned it slipping through my fingers? I decided to make a change. After nearly 20 years of various cycles of alcohol abuse, moderation and abstinence, I concluded I would take one last shot at forging a balanced approach to drinking before turning to sobriety. Iâ€™d read about a drug called naltrexone, which is a pill that helps mitigate and manage alcohol cravings and abuse. After sporadically trying it over the prior year, I decided to use it every day for the next three months. Change came quickly. Two months in, my weekly consumption had cut in half it would cut in half again by early October. I lost 20 pounds and felt great. In tears, I confided to my wife, â€œIâ€™ve finally broken through. â€ â€œIâ€™m so proud of you,â€ my wife replied. â€œIâ€™m so grateful you found a path that works. Letâ€™s stick with it. â€ That was Monday, 10 October. Two days later, I was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer. Less than 15% of people with my diagnosis survive five years. This prompted a swift resolution of my other core challenge: I would no longer allow my anxiety about â€œliving the right wayâ€ interfere with being my true self in all dimensions of this life. There would no longer be any distinction between the â€œrepresentative versionâ€ of me online versus living every day with full authenticity. Any other way would be a total waste of time. Iâ€™ve embraced the news as an invitation to be my most honest, vulnerable and wholehearted self. I live every day as fully integrated and courageously as possible. I donâ€™t waver. One key outlet has been a podcast I started with my wife and best friend called Defending Your Life, where we process in real time the unfiltered experience, fears and reality of dealing with stage IV cancer. I write now more directly, less esoterically, about my experience on my blog. Although my opportunities to achieve my public service or other professional goals down the road may now be limited by time or strength, I now know they wonâ€™t be hobbled by inauthenticity. Most importantly, Iâ€™ve come to recognize that I have lived a life of meaning and purpose. A life rich with love and connection. Some have even generously shared that Iâ€™ve lived a life that has inspired others. And, having worked through my demons, Iâ€™m able to forgive and be proud of myself too. Of course, whatâ€™s scary now is while there is so much to live for, this disease, despite all the science, love and everything else needed to take it on, could very well ultimately beat me. I had surgery in October and am facing upcoming systemic treatments over the next months, and it remains to be seen whether that will make me one of the % who achieve a â€œcomplete responseâ€ or the 94% who end up somewhere else along the kidney cancer progression line. The truth is, weâ€™re all terminal. I could also get hit by a bus tomorrow. Or I could beat the odds and live till Iâ€™m 90. But whatever my time left on this earth, Iâ€™ll now endeavor forward with some earned resolve. I am the person I want to be. Iâ€™m not afraid.",0

Retired district judge George Allen ruled Friday that Richard Bryan Kussmaul, 45, should be free. His three codefendants each received sentences and have already been released. DNA evidence not available two decades ago shows the four werenâ€™t involved in the fatal shootings of Leslie Murphy and Stephen Neighbors at a home near Moody, south of Waco, Allen said in a opinion. Allenâ€™s recommendation now goes to the Texas court of criminal appeals for a final decision. The stateâ€™s top criminal appeals court had ordered a hearing held last month to look into the menâ€™s claims they were innocent. â€œThe evidence just seemed overwhelming, with the DNA evidence having excluded these men from any contact whatsoever with these people,â€ Kussmaulâ€™s lawyer, David Sheppard, told the Waco . Allen presided over the trial where Kussmaul was convicted of murder. His three James Edward Long, Michael Dewayne Shelton and James Wayne Pitts Jr, were convicted of sexual assault. Long and Pitts served 20 years. Shelton was released after 17 years. At the hearing last month, Long, Shelton and Pitts all testified they gave false testimony against Kussmaul at his trial because a prosecutor promised them probation. They also said their confessions were coerced by a deputy who threatened them with the death penalty. The three said at Kussmaulâ€™s trial in 1994 that he and they raped Murphy before Kussmaul shot the two victims. After they were sentenced to 20 years in prison, each recanted his confession. Kussmaul did not testify at the hearing. â€œI was willing to say anything they wanted me to say because I thought I was getting probation and no prison time,â€ Long said at the July hearing. â€œI had two small children and I was afraid of going to prison for life or, worse, getting executed. â€ If the court upholds the judgeâ€™s opinion and the menâ€™s claims of actual innocence, they each could be eligible for a state payout of $80, 000 for each year in prison.",0
"249","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/28/my-dads-reagan-protests-inspire-me-to-stand-up-to-donald-trump","Steven W Thrasher","I have been battling depression and sleeplessness while thinking about how to fight Donald Trump and what his rise means about the United States of America. It is dispiriting that after both modest and substantial gains have been made during the Obama and Black Lives Matter years (on race, gender, political imagination, LGBT rights and healthcare) many stand to be rolled back with a vengeance in the coming months and years. The retrenchment is frightening. And itâ€™s become clear that this fight is going to last for the rest of my life. For advice on how to deal with this, I turned to my late father, Bill Thrasher. He was an air force sergeant who went to night school as an adult to become a high school and community college teacher of US and â€œAfro Americanâ€ history. My dad died suddenly, in 2003, while teaching a class full of students a blood clot killed him instantly while he was lecturing about the civil war and the reconstruction. His sudden death broke my heart, but he left me with a road map: the example of a civil rights life well lived, a binder of newspaper clippings from a column he wrote in our local newspaper, and a single audio recording of a monthly radio show in Ventura, California, he hosted called Minority Perspective. That sole episode I have was broadcast on 7 December 1986. It was Pearl Harbor day, and the height of Reaganâ€™s affair. In it, Dad laments his sadness after the previous monthâ€™s election, when California voters a deeply conservative governor. Hereâ€™s a passage which gave me life after Trump was elected: Conservatism, by its nature, is racism. Itâ€™s racism only because conservatism simply means to conserve, to preserve the status quo. And the status quo with respect to minorities, is: â€œStay in your place! Remain the same, exactly where youâ€™re at. Be the victims of discrimination! Do not protest. Let the laws stand as they are. Do not enact laws that will try to redress grievances. â€ So when the county of Ventura, the state of California, and the United States of America votes to support conservative candidates who represent those viewpoints, it is saying to us, the minorities: â€œItâ€™s gone too far! You must stay in your place. There will be no more change. You must continue wherever you are at. You will always be on the low end of the pole economically and politically. â€ And that is why it is so difficult for Afro Americans to accept the conservatives, no matter who they happen to be, whether they are in the Republican party or the Democratic party. Because conservatism, by its very nature, is racist! Itâ€™s . Itâ€™s American. Itâ€™s . Itâ€™s American. Itâ€™s American. Itâ€™s that isnâ€™t white, Anglo Saxon, Protestant male. Because that group wants to preserve what it has illegally gained and wishes to continue â€” in politics, and in economics. And it will use the political institution to keep their gains, even though they werenâ€™t gained honestly or legally. Thatâ€™s my objection to conservatism. Conservatism will prevent my children and my grandchildren from fulfilling their destiny as Americans. My children and my grandchildren, as well as I am, as well my father and my grandfather and my were citizens and are citizens, and conservatism wants to keep us as citizens. I am not going to accept that! I will spend all of my energies fighting that type of thought, and I urge all minorities â€” not just Afro Americans, but all minorities â€” to resist this. We have to do whatever we can, everywhere, wherever weâ€™re at, in whatever capacity weâ€™re in, to keep the issue alive â€” to keep pushing, to keep probing, to keep challenging, until we have forged our way into the economic and political system, where we have a control our of destiny, and not have to leave it in control of people who are antagonistic toward us, who hate us, who do not want to see us have a share in the American dream. Listening to my father fighting Reaganism, 30 years ago next week, is both depressing and freeing as I think about fighting Trumpism. I feel depressed that the same issues he fought remain so present some three decades later â€” issues that wonâ€™t be solved in my lifetime. But I also feel less alone in knowing that I am connected to him â€” and to my ancestors and nieces and nephews â€” in an intergenerational struggle for a better America. Even if the fight doesnâ€™t end with me, I hope to ease the path for those who follow, or at least give the comfort that my fatherâ€™s words lend me today. Trump and his ilk will try to say â€œstay in your placeâ€ to all of us who arenâ€™t conservative white men accommodationist white liberals will do so, as well. Fortunately, I know where (and who) I come from, and I can listen to my dad pushing back on Reaganism to guide me when I feel lost in Trumpland. If you, too, are feeling down about the fight ahead, donâ€™t be afraid to ask your elders for guidance. They might just show the way towards the road just when you need it most.",0
"250","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/07/flatmates-of-gay-syrian-refugee-beheaded-in-turkey-fear-they-will-be-next","Patrick Kingsley","Three flatmates of a gay Syrian refugee beheaded in a homophobic attack in Turkey last week fear they face a similar fate, after receiving death threats in the days since his murder. Wisam Sankari, a hospital cleaner, went missing on 25 July after going to meet another gay man in Istanbul. His body was found two days later in a nearby area of Istanbul, his head severed and his battered body only identifiable to his friends by his clothing. A week on, three of his flatmates say they fear being murdered in the same fashion after receiving warnings that the man Sankari met on 25 July wants to kill them too. â€œThere have been people in the street and people on the phone, who said: â€˜He will get you next,â€™â€ said one of Sankariâ€™s friends, a chef who, like his flatmates, asked to remain anonymous for safety reasons. â€œThere was also a voice message on Facebook. â€ In an interview with the Guardian in Sankariâ€™s former room, a cramped lodging he shared with five other people, his friends said he had been in fear during the last months of his life after Turkish officials, UN diplomats and charity workers had proved unable to protect him following a series of homophobic attacks. A Greek appeals board said in June that it considers Turkey safe enough for gay Syrians to be deported to as part of the controversial migration deal. But Sankariâ€™s friends say his experiences show how dangerous the country is for gay refugees, and unstable for refugees in general. They alleged that in the months before his death, Sankari had: â€œDo you call this safe?â€ summarised a second of Sankariâ€™s flatmates, as they listened to their friendâ€™s favourite song and watched a video made in his honour. â€œWe donâ€™t have an organisation to protect us. We want everyone in Europe to understand our situation here for Syrians, especially gays. Weâ€™re suffering. â€ This was the third brutal attack Sankari had experienced, the flatmate continued. â€œFive months ago, he was attacked and his head was cut,â€ he said. â€œHe went to the police, but they didnâ€™t help him. [Another time] he was put in a car and he had to throw himself from it [to survive]. â€ Then at 12. 20am on 25 July, he got a call from a Syrian who had recently arrived in Istanbul. â€œHe went to see him, and he never came back. Two days later we heard he was dead. â€ Sankariâ€™s murder was one of at least 20 homophobic attacks on Syrian refugees in the past six months, according to an activist who is documenting such incidents. â€œTurkey is not a safe place, itâ€™s not a place,â€ said Hossam, a Syrian who organises a weekly support session for gay refugees in Istanbul, and who asked to be identified only by his first name. â€œAnd with the political situation in the country, itâ€™s not getting better. â€ More generally, Sankariâ€™s friends said many of his other experiences showed how vulnerable life is for refugees of any sexuality in Turkey. Despite recent legislative changes, the vast majority of the 2. 7 million Syrians in Turkey have no realistic chance of accessing the legal labour market, forcing them to work illegally in exploitative conditions that contravene the UN refugee convention. Sankari was one such case. His latest employers paid him about half the Turkish minimum wage (600 Turkish lira, or Â£150) for a hospital cleaning job that saw him work seven days a week. If he complained, he risked being fired during previous employment as a waiter at a cafe, he was sacked for asking for time off to recover from illness. â€œWeâ€™re working as animals,â€ said one of Sankariâ€™s friends, a literature graduate who was a teacher in Syria but now works as a waiter in Turkey. â€œNo one is working at what they studied for. We work here hours a day. We donâ€™t have a weekend. The Turks want us to work and work and work â€” without money or rights. â€ Sankariâ€™s battles with Turkish bureaucracy also highlight the basic logistical challenges Syrians face on a daily basis in Turkey. Sankari struggled to access support from aid groups and officials in Istanbul because he had first registered with the Turkish government in Hatay, a city near the countryâ€™s southern borders. To apply for resettlement in the west, or to secure even basic support from NGOs, Sankari needed to return to Hatay. But he was scared to do so because of threats he had faced while briefly living there, said Hossam, who had met Sankari at his weekly session. â€œHe was desperately seeking help but he couldnâ€™t reach anyone,â€ said Hossam. It is a depressingly familiar situation, the activist added. â€œDuring my time with the group, Iâ€™ve witnessed a lot of serious threats, a lot of hate crimes, people who have experienced incidents that didnâ€™t necessarily end their life, but [involved] beatings, rape and abuse,â€ said Hossam. â€œAnd those people couldnâ€™t reach places where they felt safe and secure. They had to deal with this on their own. â€ A senior government official said: â€œWe are unable to independently verify the claim that the victimâ€™s plea for assistance was ignored by law enforcement. Obviously, this barbaric attack doesnâ€™t reflect the way Syrian refugees are treated in Turkey, which is the largest host of refugees in the world. We are investigating this incident and will take all necessary steps to bring perpetrators to justice. â€ In a statement, the UN refugee agency said it was working to resettle LGBTI refugees currently living in Turkey, and expressed sadness about Sankariâ€™s death. A spokesperson added: â€œWe are very sorry and we would like to express our shock and sadness at this appalling crime. We are looking forward to seeing that investigation of the case by the officials concluded asap and perpetrators are brought to justice. â€œSyrian refugees in Turkey are given temporary protection by the government of Turkey, which is primarily responsible for their protection in the country. UNHCR does not register or document Syrian refugees in Turkey. â€",0
"251","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/23/jaffas-and-daredevils-life-on-the-worlds-steepest-street","Eleanor Ainge Roy",", Most people take 10 minutes to climb the worldâ€™s steepest residential street. But Bindi Bezar, who works in a gift shop near the bottom, does it in seven. â€œI have angina and climbing 276 steps is cheaper than going to the gym,â€ said Bezar. Baldwin Street, located on the north face of Signal Hill in Dunedin, New Zealand, is booming. Since being listed in the Guinness Book of Records for its exhausting 1:3 gradient, it has enjoyed local interest. But now Dunedin is a stopping point for international cruise ships, the street has become the top tourist destination in New Zealandâ€™s oldest city. In the busy season between October and February, hundreds of tourists visit the street each day, starting at 6am and often continuing until dark â€” which in the summer can be 11pm. It has also become a hot spot for daredevil sports enthusiasts who trike, bike and slide down the slope in anything with wheels. In response, a host of entrepreneurial residents have opened gift shops and food outlets â€” with more permanent infrastructure such as public toilets potentially on the horizon. Beverley McClay has lived on the street for nine years, and delights in the growing popularity of her home. From her porch, she often watches strangers open her gate, potter around her garden, and occasionally â€” and most unwelcomely â€” relieve themselves in her Corokia hedge. â€œI think a lot of tourists donâ€™t know this is a real street, that people actually live here,â€ she laughs. â€œItâ€™s very social, very busy. I often come out in my dressing grown to meet people, and the tourists like to watch me stacking wood, they ask me what I am doing. â€ McClay, who lives alone, says the streetâ€™s fame has stopped her from becoming lonely as the years go by. â€œIt makes me feel like I am part of a community here, thereâ€™s always someone just outside my door. â€ In the past year Baldwin Street has also become a destination in an unusual social media trend to snap pictures at odd angles, which create the optical illusion of the houses being severely lopsided. The trend has significantly increased visitor numbers â€” especially during the winter season when tourists usually avoided the area because of frost, ice and occasional snow. However, to McClayâ€™s disappointment, people are now tending to drive to the top of the street instead of walking, and preferring to use selfie sticks rather than asking residents to take their picture. On Friday, the street was crammed with an estimated 15, 000 people for the annual Jaffa race, in which 75, 000 chocolate balls were rolled down the hill. â€œItâ€™s my busiest day of the year,â€ said Bezar, who has become particularly fond of the visiting shipâ€™s captains, whose drinks she always serves first. â€œI know itâ€™s just a street, but most of the residents here are so friendly, itâ€™s also become a really good way to have a chat to a Kiwi. And â€” itâ€™s free. â€",0
"252","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/nsa-contractor-arrested-harold-thomas-martin-edward-snowden","Ewen MacAskill","The FBI has arrested a National Security Agency contractor on suspicion of the theft of top secret classified data and documents in an alleged security breach at the same intelligence agency whose spy secrets were exposed by Edward Snowden. Disclosure of the documents stolen â€œcould be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the USâ€ claimed the justice department in a press release giving details of the criminal complaint against Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland. He was charged with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor, and, it emerged on Wednesday, has been in detention since a court appearance on 29 August. Details of the arrest were first reported by the New York Times, which suggested the breach involved the possible theft of highly classified computer code developed to hack into the networks of foreign governments. â€œThere is no evidence that Hal Martin intended to betray his country,â€ said Martinâ€™s attorneys Jim Wyda and Deborah Boardman in a statement, according to the Washington Post. â€œWhat we do know is that Hal Martin loves his family and his country. He served honorably in the United States Navy as a lieutenant and he has devoted his entire career to protecting his country. We look forward to defending Hal Martin in court. â€ They said the charges against Martin were â€œmere allegationsâ€ and they had not yet seen prosecutorsâ€™ evidence. The justice department confirmed that Martin worked for the same company as Snowden when he exposed details of NSA mass surveillance methods three years ago. Martin has been in custody since a court appearance in August. According to the New York Times, Martin is suspected of taking the â€œsource codeâ€ developed by the agency to break into computer systems of adversaries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Snowden, who remains in exile in Russia, facing charges under the Espionage Act, reacted to the details of the arrest, tweeting to his 2. 4 million followers: â€œThis is huge. Did the FBI secretly arrest the person behind the reports NSA sat on huge flaws in US products?â€ The White House said Barack Obama took the national security implications seriously. Press secretary Josh Earnest told a briefing: â€œI think any time that information like this is released in the context of a criminal complaint, the federal government is reminded of how important is it to be vigilant about protecting the national security of the country and information that is relevant to our national security. â€œSo this is certainly a situation that the Department of Justice takes seriously, as evidenced by their complaint, but this is a situation that President Obama takes quite seriously, and it is a good reminder for all of us with security clearances about how important is it for us to protect sensitive national security information. â€ The justice department confirmed: â€œA criminal complaint has been filed charging Harold Thomas Martin III, 51, of Glen Burnie, Maryland, with theft of government property and unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials by a government employee or contractor. â€ The assistant attorney general for national security, John Carlin, US attorney Rod Rosenstein for the District of Maryland and special agent in charge Gordon Johnson of the FBIâ€™s Baltimore field office made the announcement. According to the affidavit, Martin was a contractor with the federal government and had a top secret national security clearance. He was arrested late on 27 August as search warrants were executed at his home, two storage sheds and his vehicle on a leafy suburban street outside of Baltimore. â€œI heard a boom and went to the ground,â€ Dave Cunningham, who lives a couple of doors down from Martin and described himself as a â€œliferâ€ in the neighborhood, said of the raid on Martinâ€™s home. He said he thought it was a gunshot. But when he looked out the window, he saw numerous law enforcement vehicles, including two large vans that parked in front of the house. Glen Bond, who has lived in a house across the street from Bond for 50 years, said there were two big vans in front of the house blocking it from view and â€œ25 or 30 carsâ€. â€œThey were in camouflaged uniforms, two dozen of them. They were serious. Helmets, rifles,â€ Murray Bennett, who lives next door to Martin, said. â€œBig guns,â€ Bond said. â€œWhen they came they took out a whole bunch of stuff but it was all in black trash bags. You couldnâ€™t see anything. â€ A woman who came to the door of Martinâ€™s home said: â€œThis is a matter thatâ€™s under investigation. I have no comment . .. Iâ€™d appreciate it if youâ€™d leave from the front of my house so my dogs will calm down and I can get some peace. â€ Neighbors describe Martin and the woman he lives with â€” no one could say whether they were married â€” as â€œniceâ€ â€œdecentâ€ and â€œpeacefulâ€. During execution of the warrants, investigators found documents and digital information stored on various devices and removable digital media. â€œA large percentage of the materials recovered from Martinâ€™s residence and vehicle bore markings indicating that they were property of the US government and contained highly classified information, including Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). In addition, investigators located property of the US government with an aggregate value in excess of $1, 000, which Martin allegedly stole,â€ a justice department press statement said. Martin is said to have had six classified documents obtained from sensitive intelligence and produced by a government agency in 2014. â€œThese documents were produced through sensitive government sources, methods and capabilities, which are critical to a wide variety of national security issues. The disclosure of the documents would reveal those sensitive sources, methods and capabilities,â€ the justice department said. The documents have been reviewed by a government agency and designated as top secret, â€œmeaning that unauthorized disclosure reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the USâ€ the justice department statement said. If convicted, Martin faces a maximum sentence of one year in prison for the unauthorized removal and retention of classified materials and 10 years in prison for theft of government property. An initial appearance was held for Martin in US district court in Baltimore on 29 August and he is still detained. The arrest is a major embarrassment for the NSA and its contractor Booz Allen coming just three years after Snowden, who worked for both. The NSA said in the wake of the Snowden revelations in 2013 it had tightened up internal security, introducing more stringent monitoring of staff and a system in which sensitive information needed two people to access it rather than just one. Highly classified information would no longer be concentrated in one place, making it harder for potential hackers. The new breach provides fresh arguments for privacy activists who argue that the NSA cannot be trusted to protect all the personal data it gathers, from bank accounts to health records. Supporters of Snowden quickly made a distinction between him and the motives of the arrested man. They reiterated that Snowden is a whistleblower who leaked top secret material out of principle, believing the NSA was acting unconstitutionally by engaging in mass surveillance. It was not yet clear what motivated the latest alleged leaker. Snowden, who had worked for the CIA and the NSA, handed over material to journalists at the Guardian in 2013 when he was employed by Booz Allen as contractor to the NSA. As a computer specialist based in Hawaii, he was engaged in a number of operations, including targeting China. Flying from Hawaii, where he was based, to Hong Kong, he gave tens of thousands of top secret documents to journalists to illustrate the scale of surveillance by the NSA and Britainâ€™s GCHQ. The documents also revealed the extent to which major US tech companies were cooperating with the NSA in providing details from customer accounts. Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists who was given material by Snowden, rounded on the NSA for its lack of security. â€œNobody is more inept at securing its own data than NSA. But trust them to keep all yours safe and secure. â€ Jesselyn Radack, a US lawyer who represents whistleblowers, was among those quick to caution journalists about making comparisons with Snowden. In a tweet, she wrote: â€œMediapls stop comparing theft of NSA source code to @Snowden blowing whistle on secret domestic surveillance. â€",0
"253","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/24/trump-university-shut-down-conflict-of-interest","Ben Jacobs","Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will shut down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over conflicts related to the â€™s charitable and business interests. In a statement released by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be â€œdissolvedâ€ to avoid â€œeven the appearance of any conflict with my role as Presidentâ€. Trump said he would continue to pursue his â€œstrong interest in philanthropyâ€ in other ways. The closure of the Trump Foundation, which was first reported by the New York Times, requires the approval of the New York attorney generalâ€™s office, which is currently investigating the nonprofit and issued a cease and desist order to it in October. The Donald J Trump Foundation was repeatedly the subject of controversy throughout the presidential campaign after a series of investigations by the Washington Postâ€™s David Fahrenthold. Trump reportedly used $258, 000 of the foundationâ€™s money to pay for personal legal settlements. He also spent charitable funds on multiple portraits of himself and on a football helmet autographed by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow. The foundation also made a donation to a political group supporting Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump backer in violation of tax law. The has since paid $2, 500 to the Internal Revenue Service over the donation. Trump had not donated to his own foundation since 2008 the nonprofit relied on donations from other Trump associates, including professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. Linda McMahon has since been announced as Trumpâ€™s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration. The decision also comes as Trumpâ€™s children have been under scrutiny for charitable efforts that raised questions over whether people were paying for access to the incoming president and his family. A celebrity auction for a coffee date with Ivanka Trump, sponsored by Eric Trumpâ€™s charity, was called off earlier in December because donors were apparently given an attempt to curry favor with the incoming president and buy access to one of his closest advisers. Both Eric and his brother, Don Jr, were also scheduled to appear at a reception on behalf of conservation charities over the weekend of the inauguration. The reception, which has since been canceled, reportedly promised the opportunity to meet the in exchange for $1m in donations. These issues have come as Trumpâ€™s entire real estate business has come under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In particular, Trumpâ€™s international properties have the potential to violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits anyone holding â€œan office of profit or trustâ€ from accepting â€œany present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign stateâ€. But these conflicts also apply domestically, as the Kuwaiti government has already announced that it is shifting its annual party in February to Trumpâ€™s new hotel in Washington. The issues are further amplified because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns. The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has. It is known, though, that Trump owes $364m to Deutsche Bank. A news conference that the promised to hold on the topic on 15 December has since been postponed until sometime in January 2017.",0
"254","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/06/serbia-rowers-sunk-capsize-rio-olympics","Sean Ingle","Most Olympic rowers have spent months fretting and prepping about the dangers of mosquitos and adenoviruses lurking in the Lagoa Rodrigo de Freitas. Few, though, were ready to face vicious crosswinds and waters so choppy that it left a Serbian boat capsized and others claiming these were the worst conditions they had ever encountered. Matt Smith, the executive director of rowingâ€™s governing body, Fisa, defended the decision not to postpone racing â€” but warned rowers that conditions were likely to get even worse on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, which could even lead to rounds being cancelled. â€œItâ€™s a small regatta, with 550 rowers, so we can pretty easily make up one day,â€ he said. â€œBut if we get two or three knocked out then we go into contingency mode, and into scenarios where we possible drop rounds. We told team managers on Thursday that if you lose rounds of racing, your results from previous races could determine your placement in finals or . They are on notice that every race matters because if we lose two or three daysâ€™ racing it could be the case. â€ Smith was speaking after loud complaints about racing on the opening day being allowed to go ahead, despite the weather, which led to several rowers nearly capsizing before the Serbian menâ€™s pair of Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik went into the water when their boat caught a crab. Usually rowers have to finish the course to be allowed to race again in the repechage. Fisa, however, ruled that because of the conditions and the fact they were behind in the schedule, the rowers could take a DNF â€” did not finish â€” and still compete in the repechage on Sunday at 9. 30am. Fisa also denied that the Serbians faced any dangers from falling into the water. â€œIt is nearly drinking water,â€ Smith said. â€œItâ€™s swimming quality. Itâ€™s really good. Some might say there are viruses there, but itâ€™s amazingly good right now. â€ Most rowers did not take such a rosy view. The Australian Kim Brennan, a competitor in single sculls, was a particularly vociferous critic, insisting the course was â€œnot rowableâ€. â€œI do think it should have been called off,â€ she said. â€œAnd speaking to a lot of rowers in the boat park thereâ€™s a lot of discontent. Weâ€™ve put 10 years plus into this and to have it decided on a little bit of lottery, and what waves hit a boat at a particular time, is a little bit disappointing. â€ Every race had its dramas that went beyond seeing who would cross the line first. At one point, the American sculler Genevra Stone nearly sunk like, well, a stone. While the Egyptian sculler Nadia Negm reckoned the conditions were the worst in which she had rowed. â€œI actually thought I was going to sink it was so rough,â€ Negm said. â€œAt one point, just past 1, 000m, there were these huge waves and a full one came right into my boat and the water was up to my seat. I was 100% sure I was going to sink, and then another wave came up and I just stopped and froze. Thank God I didnâ€™t go under. Itâ€™s the toughest conditions I have ever rowed in. It was really intense. I wish the rest of the racers good luck â€” if you are rowing this week you better know how to swim. â€ Meanwhile, the Irish sculler Sanita Puspure, who finished one place ahead of Negm in second, described the conditions as â€œhorrificâ€. She said: â€œIt was like sailing, surfing, everything all in one and a bit of rowing in the end. I was just thrown around with the wind. I couldnâ€™t get the blades in at the same time. At one stage I was blown parallel to the racing lane so I had to tack with one arm into the lane, which is probably unseen before â€” a person doing rowing during a race. I was pretty helpless. â€ But Britainâ€™s Kath Grainger â€” who, along with her partner, Vicky Thornley, qualified for the double sculls semiâ€‘finals by finishing second in her heat â€” disagreed. While saying that it was â€œthe worst Olympic conditions I have raced inâ€ she felt it was right to race on. â€œIf the regatta runs you have to race in whatever the conditions are,â€ she insisted. The British sculler Alan Campbell, who looked particularly impressive in winning his heat, claimed the conditions reminded him of coastal rowing. He said: â€œI thought I must be losing time and I looked around and there was a blade in the air and one down there. â€ â€œThe wind comes down from the mountain,â€ he added, pointing to the most famous landmark on the Rio skyline. â€œChrist The Redeemer needs to spread his arms out a little more. â€",0

Anderson absolutely didnâ€™t murder Assange with a Pret vegan sandwich on Saturday. Not even a bit. I mean, by those standards, neither did I. But Anderson really didnâ€™t. Can we track this back to the beginning for a second? Sure. On Saturday, Anderson visited Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London. She brought him a vegan sandwich from Pret. And he remained staunchly unmurdered. Iâ€™m so confused. Was she supposed to murder him? No, not at all. But he went quiet after the visit, and rumours began to swirl that he was dead from Andersonâ€™s bready hand. Is this real life? Did this actually happen? Yes, and it was exacerbated when Wikileaks began tweeting things such as â€œ 1: John Kerry 4bb96075acadc3d80b5ac872874c3037a386f4f595fe99e687439aabd0219809â€ which some people read as a dead manâ€™s switch to be activated in the event of Assangeâ€™s death.

"256","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/25/donald-trump-pivot-hillary-clinton-debate","Sabrina Siddiqui","From the moment in May when Donald Trump all but sealed the Republican presidential nomination, he has been faced with a nagging question: when will he pivot? When would a new Trump emerge â€” a candidate able to appeal to more than the angry base who propelled him to primary victory over much more seasoned politicians? In the Republican establishment, the wait for the pivot began after Trump forced his remaining opponents out of the race, in Indiana four months ago. It continued through the convention in Cleveland in July. Once he had been formally nominated, the thinking went, maybe then the pivot would come. It didnâ€™t. On Monday, the first presidential debate against Hillary Clinton takes place, at Hofstra University in New York. As Trump prepares to face the largest audience of the cycle thus far, the fabled pivot is nowhere in sight. Urged by those who reluctantly embraced him to tone down his rhetoric, Trump has in recent weeks attempted to show he is capable of discipline. After doing without teleprompters for much of the primary, he turned to reading from scripts written by advisers brought in to save a sinking campaign. He also embarked on an â€œoutreachâ€ effort aimed at some minority communities, suddenly incorporating into his stump speech lines about the plight of African American voters. But Trumpâ€™s platform, his slate of signature policies, chief among them his line on immigration, has remained exactly the same. And at the debate, some opposed to Trump worry, such details may be lost. Behind a podium, on primetime TV, appearance and style, not policy, often dictate who wins and who loses. â€œThe fact that his base, even his ardent white nationalist supporters, are not complaining about his message pivots is a clear sign that his policies remain substantively the same,â€ said Frank Sharry, executive director of the immigration reform advocacy group Americaâ€™s Voice. On immigration, Sharry said, Trump hinted for weeks at a â€œsofteningâ€ â€” and secured commensurate media coverage. Then he delivered a speech in Phoenix that â€œdoubled down on his radical proposalsâ€ such as deporting the roughly 11 million undocumented migrants who live in America today. â€œThatâ€™s not a policy pivot, itâ€™s a Kellyanne messaging pivot,â€ Sharry said, referring to the Republican pollster hired in August as Trumpâ€™s campaign manager. â€œThe idea was to make it sound like he was â€˜softeningâ€™ in hopes of bringing home suburban voters, mostly women, who are uncomfortable voting for a racist. â€ A similar tactic was employed regarding Trumpâ€™s proposal to ban all Muslim immigration, which was widely criticized even among Republican elected officials. Trump rebranded the plan as â€œextreme vettingâ€ rooted in an ideological test, but when asked directly plainly denied he was walking back the Muslim ban and said he was in fact strengthening it. Last week, Donald Trump Jr once more revealed the campaignâ€™s thinking, tweeting a photo of a bowl of Skittles as a metaphor for refugees from Syria. If a few were poisoned and could kill you, he asked, would you want any at all? Trumpâ€™s first television ad, released last month, depicted immigrants streaming across the border. The commercial claimed that under a Clinton presidency, â€œSyrian refugees flood in. Illegal immigrants convicted of committing crime get to stay â€” collecting social security benefits, skipping the line. â€ Rick Wilson, a Republican strategist and leader of the Never Trump movement, made a similar assessment to Sharryâ€™s. If there had been any strategic change from the Trump campaign, he said, it was only done to find ways for the nominee to mollify undecided voters uncomfortable with his comments about Latinos, Muslims and other demographics. â€œThereâ€™s been no real pivot on immigration and thereâ€™s been no real pivot that he has any desire to communicate with Hispanic voters,â€ said Wilson, who also cited Trumpâ€™s efforts to discuss the concerns of black voters. â€œDonald Trump can give a hot damn about African Americans, but he comes out and says, â€˜I want to help inner cities,â€™â€ he said. â€œThatâ€™s not really about African American voters, but about white suburban voters. â€ While Trump has discussed the challenges facing the African American community, he has largely done so in the company of his own supporters or in the comfortable confines of Fox News. When he did travel to Flint, Michigan, the site of a crisis over water poisoned by lead, Trump praised the executives implicated in the scandal and criticized a black pastor who interrupted him when he made a political speech at a predominantly black church. Last week, Trump made headlines for saying African Americans were in their â€œworst shape everâ€ an echo of his claim that black voters have nothing left to lose, because they lack jobs and education and are disproportionately affected by crime, and should therefore vote for him. â€œHeâ€™s a crafty enough salesman and a crafty enough conman to know that he cannot confuse the object with the subject,â€ said Wilson. There may be no pivot, but the strategy of appearing to make one, to some of the people some of the time, is paying electoral dividends. Despite there being no indication that minority voters will turn out in the Republicanâ€™s favor, polling has tightened. In Philadelphia recently, Stacye Mccollum braved the late summer heat to watch Barack Obama stump for Clinton. An African American voter from Manayunk, Pennsylvania, she stood a dozen steps away from the first black president. Trumpâ€™s latest â€œpivotâ€ had not gone unnoticed. Referencing â€œthe one comment he had made [about how] â€˜I donâ€™t understand why African Americans are voting for Democrats, because Democrats havenâ€™t do[ne] you well. You have no job, youâ€™re low povertyâ€ Mccollum said she had taken only one thing away from Trumpâ€™s version of outreach. â€œI found him to be very condescending,â€ she said.",0
"257","https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/10/ivory-trade-ban-international-summit-hawaii","Oliver Milman","A resolution to end the domestic trade in ivory has descended into acrimony at a major conservation summit, with a handful of countries, including Japan and South Africa, objecting to the proposed ban. A coalition of countries, including the US, France, Gabon, Kenya and Malawi, spoke in favor of an International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) motion that calls for every country to ban their internal trade of ivory. However, delegates from Japan, Namibia and South Africa argued that domestic ivory markets should be left open as long as they are regulated. Canada voiced concerns that the ivory ban would affect trade of walrus and narwhal, which are hunted by indigenous people in the country. South Africa and Namibia even threatened to end their membership of IUCN over the wording of the motion, according to sources at the world conservation congress, which is being held in Hawaii. After two days of deadlocked talks, the resolution will be discussed further on Saturday in a bid to find consensus. The intransigence of some countries has enraged environmental groups that make up the bulk of the IUCNâ€™s membership, which also includes 217 state and national government agencies. â€œIt is disappointing that we are now told we have to meet again for a contact group [a negotiating session] since a few members were not pleased with the outcome of previous discussions,â€ said Sue Lieberman, of international policy at the Wildlife Conservation Society, a cosponsor of the motion. â€œThereâ€™s truly a crisis for elephants and we need to close the elephant ivory markets. The overwhelming majority of the earlier contact group wanted to close domestic ivory markets. â€ Danny Auron, campaign director at Avaaz, similarly expressed frustration. â€œEvery 15 minutes an elephant is slaughtered for its tusks, and at this rate theyâ€™ll be gone forever in a few short years,â€ he said. â€œIf we want this species to survive, governments need to be falling over themselves to strengthen protections, not fighting to water them down. â€ While the IUCN does not regulate the ivory trade, it is hoped that a resolution calling for the end of domestic markets will help spur nations to commit to a ban at the Cites convention, held in Johannesburg later this month. It is through the Cites treaty that the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989. John Scanlon, of Cites, told the Guardian the forthcoming convention â€œis without doubt one of the most critical meetings of Cites in its history. â€œIt is clear that this [IUCN] motion is generating an intense and robust debate amongst the membership of IUCN, with differing views being strongly expressed. â€ The IUCN resolution calls on governments around the world to â€œclose their domestic markets for elephant ivory as a matter of urgencyâ€. The motion states that IUCN members are â€œdeeply concernedâ€ by the illegal killing of elephants that threatens the speciesâ€™ survival, harms national security and undermines sustainable economic development in countries where elephants are found in the wild. Millions of elephants once roamed throughout Africa and from the coast of Persia through India and deep into China. Habitat loss and rampant poaching has drastically reduced this number, with African elephants now being killed at a faster rate than they are reproducing. The first ever census of Africaâ€™s savannah elephants found that nearly a third were wiped out between 2007 and 2014. Poachers target the animals to supply ivory from their tusks in Asia. Gangs can get $1, 100 per kilogram for ivory in China, which announced last year it would shut down its own domestic market. Ivory can also be found by buyers in many western countries. A recent report by the NGO Traffic found that the antiques ivory market in the UK appeared to have declined significantly, though there are still thousands of ivory items on sale in Londonâ€™s markets. Even though the international trade in ivory has been banned for more than 25 years, a flourishing black market has led to the slaughter of elephants, as well as the people charged with protecting them. A separate IUCN motion to protect 30% of the worldâ€™s oceans was agreed with little dispute. The resolution, if adopted by countries, would drastically increase the small amount of marine area currently off limits to commercial fishing and drilling. A related motion that supports marine protected areas on the high seas, which are beyond national jurisdiction, also passed. â€œThese motions will help reverse the tide of habitat destruction, pollution and depletion of the worldâ€™s oceans,â€ said Francine Kershaw, a science fellow with the Natural Resources Defense Council. â€œBoth emphasize the need for more marine protected areas, which are scientifically supported to enhance ocean health and resilience in the face of global warming, ocean acidification and rapidly escalating industrial activities. â€ Dr Lance Morgan, president of the Marine Conservation Institute, also praised the motions. â€œThis is terrific news and will surely create momentum for establishing more marine reserves around the world in coming years,â€ he said. â€œWe know how to fix the oceans but now we need the political will and public support to make hard decisions before itâ€™s too late. â€ More than 80 other resolutions passed with little fuss. They include a call for a ban on gillnet fishing, which threatens the vaquita porpoise in Mexico, and restrictions on the trade of pangolins. Other motions backed the adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency by countries. Voting was conducted online prior to the IUCN congress.",0
"258","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/02/bad-moms-messy-motherhood-accepted-on-screen","Lara Williams","Better Things opens with its protagonist, Sam Fox, texting at a shopping mall while her daughter wails by her side. A nearby woman looks on judgmentally. â€œDo you want to buy her earrings?â€ retorts the single mom. â€œâ€™Cause thatâ€™s why sheâ€™s crying. â€™Cause I wonâ€™t buy her earrings. â€ Thanks to TV shows such as this and films such as Bad Moms and Bridget Jonesâ€™s Baby, a messier view of motherhood is having a moment in pop culture. No longer depicted as a sanctified state in which women don an apron and remove expertly prepared baked goods from the oven, motherhood â€” with its manifest challenges and residual body fluids â€” is increasingly being portrayed as more complex and more real. Sam embodies all those synonyms for â€œtiredâ€ attributed to single working mothers: fraught, frazzled, overworked. She is a jobbing actor and so is constantly putting herself in a situation in which she has to prove she is good enough. Sheâ€™s dating â€” but far from glossing over the logistics, as other shows have always done, Better Things offers a candid illustration of what that actually looks like. Sam invites an attractive director sheâ€™s working with back for dinner with her family and he is subjected to her teenage daughterâ€™s anecdote about a school friendâ€™s impromptu public defecation and her motherâ€™s latently racist compulsion to acknowledge that the director is black. Needless to say, they donâ€™t hook up. Sam canâ€™t even watch porn without being intruded upon. Yet perhaps the most radical aspect of Better Things is that Sam has motivations and ambitions that have nothing to do with being a parent. And while she is a sometimes imperfect mother, itâ€™s almost incidental she doesnâ€™t particularly characterise herself as such, only acknowledges that sheâ€™s a product of her circumstances just doing her damned best. This summer, Bad Moms also railed against polished, prescriptive modes of motherhood. After kicking out her husband for an online affair, Mila Kunis throws down the gauntlet at a meeting: â€œIâ€™m done,â€ she announces, throwing off the weight of expectation. The film tackles an interesting and rarely aired topic: (â€œsometimes I fantasise I get into a car accident, not a bad one, but I get injured, so I can stay in the hospital for a couple weeksâ€). Beholden to four children and an unsupportive husband, she is underslept and undersocialised, with no life to speak of beyond her role as mom. The message is that the role of mother has extended far beyond keeping oneâ€™s children happy and healthy to encompass a host of thankless auxiliary duties (bake sales, extracurricular activities and looking hot while doing them) that it is fundamentally impossible to be a good one. To be a modern mother is to be a bad one, doomed to failure so why not stop trying to meet an impossible standard and instead retain oneâ€™s sense of self? Bad Moms points the finger at mothers perceived as perfect, as opposed to a patriarchal and innately sexist socialisation that demands women relinquish their careers, personal lives and humanity to focus squarely on their children. In the UK thereâ€™s Motherland, Sharon Horgan and Graham Linehanâ€™s sitcom about motherhood and all of the appearance maintenance that comes with it. â€œWhy donâ€™t we have a nanny?â€ her husband asks, to which she responds: â€œBecause I want to be raised the way I was, by my mother,â€ and not â€œbecause we are not Sheryl Sandberg and David Goldbergâ€ which gives you an idea of the stakes here. When Julie is pitted against a gang of â€œalpha mumsâ€ the alphas pour scorn over her for working. â€œDonâ€™t you hate yourself?â€ they inquire. Julie finds an ally, whose is denoted by the fact she doesnâ€™t have herbal tea, in Liz. Single and working class, Liz is reviled by the other mothers, who are both terrified she will steal their husbands and discomfited because she doesnâ€™t fit their prescriptive mold of parenting. Motherland aligns our notions of idealised parenthood with wealth, revealing the heinous classism innate to it. Why are fetishised symbols of liberalism (organic food, extracurricular activities) fundamental to good parenting? What does that mean if you cannot afford it? The mothers who are flawed here are the seemingly perfect ones. Bridget Jones is perhaps the most renowned modern emblem femininity in Bridget Jonesâ€™s Baby, she is struggling to identify the paternity of her unborn child. Though Bridget Jones puts the traditionally maligned female narrative front and centre, her â€œimperfectionsâ€ still rest heavily on a few attributes: she is not teetotal, enjoys sex and is slightly heavier than most female actors in films. The Bridget Jones series has always been about wish fulfillment, later deconstructing the fairytale, usually to get content for the sequel. Pregnant at 43, Bridget wonders: â€œThis might be the only chance I get,â€ noting that she â€œalways imagined myself in OK! Magazine with the man of my dreamsâ€. Bridget has always outsourced her happiness, previously to partners and romantic interests, now to her baby and the childlike notion of the happy ending. Like getting together with Colin Firth, having the baby youâ€™ve always dreamed of doesnâ€™t guarantee personal contentment. We take responsibility for our own happiness, mothers or not. And as the credits roll, we canâ€™t help but wonder whether weâ€™ll meet her again as we did at the beginning: crying on the sofa. Perhaps the most viscerally frazzled mother to grace our screens in very recent memory is Winona Ryderâ€™s Joyce in Stranger Things. While being drawn and overwrought in the wake of her son being abducted by an unknown paranormal entity is largely expected, there is much to imply she was every bit as nervy, and chaotic â€” mostly because sheâ€™s left raising two teenage boys without any support, financial or otherwise, from their deadbeat dad. Uncomfortably, the end seems to imply she gets it together having come to appreciate what she might have lost (her child) serving up an idyllically meal, despite having no obvious additional support or income. Throughout Better Things there are flashbacks to the person who we assume is the father of Samâ€™s children. In one, we see him wake up one of her children to tell them about what sounds like a spurious career opportunity. â€œIâ€™ve got irons in the fire!â€ he says. â€œDonâ€™t tell your mother I woke you. â€ Later in the same episode, as she struggles to get through the mountainous list of shit that just needs to get done â€” taking out the trash, cooking dinner for her family, making sure her daughters havenâ€™t gone to sleep without brushing their teeth â€” it becomes apparent. Are these mothers struggling only because of inadequate fathers?",0
"259","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/30/planned-parenthood-state-repeal-abortion-restrictions","Molly Redden","Efforts are brewing in at least eight states to repeal abortion restrictions that appear to be unconstitutional after a major supreme court victory for abortion rights advocates. That is according to Planned Parenthood officials, who vowed on Thursday to support these efforts and any others that take advantage of Mondayâ€™s monumental decision. Planned Parenthood made the announcement the same day that Donald Trump, the GOPâ€™s presumptive presidential nominee, broke a puzzling silence on the ruling, known as Whole Womanâ€™s Health v Hellerstedt. Speaking to conservative radio host Mike Gallagher, Trump echoed a promise to appoint supreme court justices who oppose abortion rights. â€œIf we had Scalia was living or Scalia had been replaced by me, you wouldnâ€™t have had that, OK?â€ he said. The decision was suggesting the outcome would have been the same with Scaliaâ€™s vote or a conservative replacement. The courtâ€™s ruling on Monday struck down a Texas law that closed half the stateâ€™s abortion clinics by requiring all clinics to meet expensive, standards, and all providers to have privileges with a local hospital. In its ruling, the court found no evidence that the law made abortion safer, as its supporters claimed, and served only to make abortions harder to obtain. The law, said the majority, was therefore unconstitutional. Since the ruling was announced, calls at the state level to overturn similar restrictions spread like wildfire, Planned Parenthood officials said. Lawmakers are formulating specific plans to target similar abortion restrictions in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Virginia, and they are broadly prepared to repeal laws in Florida, Michigan and Texas. In Tennessee, Planned Parenthood is looking to support litigation by the Center for Reproductive Rights against that stateâ€™s building requirement law. They will also target Missouriâ€™s admitting privileges law. Earlier this week, officials with Planned Parenthood of Kansas and signaled that they were prepared, if necessary, to mount a legal challenge. â€œThis list is not final,â€ Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthoodâ€™s executive said on a call with reporters. Efforts to repeal harsh restrictions are sure to be met with solid resistance as long as the same lawmakers who passed the abortion restrictions still hold power. Republican lawmakers were overwhelmingly responsible for the abortion restrictions under fire, and in each of these states, the party still controls at least one house of the legislature, if not also the governorâ€™s seat. Asked how successful a legislative campaign would be under those circumstances, officials with Planned Parenthood said they were confident that these efforts had â€œmomentumâ€. â€œWe might not win everything on the first day,â€ said Laguens. â€œWe donâ€™t think for one minute that people who have spent the last decade trying to take away womenâ€™s access to abortion â€¦ are all of a sudden going to see the light â€¦ But â€˜by all means necessaryâ€™ really, is our strategy. â€ Laguens suggested that raising the profile of these statehouse battles might also energize voters around Novemberâ€™s elections. â€œI think itâ€™s a good idea for them to have a legislative strategy,â€ said Priscilla Smith, a professor at Yale Law School who has litigated abortion restrictions. Since a Republican takeover of many state legislatures kicked off a wave of abortion restrictions, she said, â€œThe movement has relied too heavily on litigation alone, and has not focused enough on legislation. â€ lawmakers will never support these efforts, Smith continued, but moderate lawmakers might be swayed. â€œItâ€™s a waste of state resources to enforce these laws in court â€¦ The same argument can be made to a legislature. Itâ€™s an appeal to reason and as much as itâ€™s an appeal to lawmakers. â€ The laws being targeted have shuttered at least a dozen abortion clinics in a region already hurting for abortion access. In Missouri, a law that requires abortion providers to have privileges with a local hospital has left the state with just one working abortion clinic, in St Louis. A Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia, Missouri, is licensed to offer abortions. But it was forced to stop providing the procedure after the University of Missouri, apparently under political pressure, suspended the clinicâ€™s privileges at the university hospital. Chris Koster, the stateâ€™s Democratic attorney general has already questioned the constitutionality of the admitting privileges law in response to Mondayâ€™s ruling. Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Virginia all require most abortion clinics to meet building requirements. Those laws forced seven abortion clinics in Virginia alone to shut down, said Helene Krasnoff, the Planned Parenthoodâ€™s director of public policy litigation. At least another ten have closed in Arizona and Michigan. Some abortion restrictions have already been toppled by Mondayâ€™s ruling â€” no legislation required. These were states with ongoing litigation against abortion restrictions. Immediately after the ruling, Alabama attorney general Luther Strange announced that he was dropping the stateâ€™s defense of its admitting privilege law. The law would have forced four out of five Alabama abortion clinics to close. On Tuesday, the supreme court declined to hear a final appeal of Wisconsinâ€™s admitting privilege law, effectively striking that law down for good. The restrictions Planned Parenthood and its allies are targeting are measures that are harder to challenge in court. Some of the laws have been on the books for many years, meaning the only abortion clinics left are in compliance. It is unclear, in those cases, if the clinics would have standing to bring a legal challenge. On Thursday, a federal judge blocked another state abortion restriction, although not as a direct result of Whole Womanâ€™s Health v Hellerstedt. District judge Tanya Walton Pratt blocked an Indiana law which barred abortions when the reason was â€œrace, color, national origin, ancestry, sex or a diagnosis or potential diagnosisâ€ of a disability or malformation.",0

She feels people have finally had enough of the current governmentâ€™s lack of transparency. â€œIâ€™ve joined in the protests at AusturvÃ¶llur, the square in front of the Parliament, many times during these last three and a half years this governmentâ€™s been in power. The mood current mood is kind of â€˜Weâ€™ve had enough! â€™â€ In spite of the protests, Halldora believes many voters have not yet decided which party to vote for. â€œThe only thing people know is that theyâ€™re not voting for the parties in power, because nothing will ever change with them in charge. â€ She hopes that the election result will give a chance for a more coalition to take charge. â€œThe polls are showing that as many as four opposition parties can join forces after the election. I think it can work. Some of the parties really want to change things and have more transparency in the system as a whole. Iâ€™m hoping for a real change this time. â€ Baldur SigurÃ°sson is a mathematician who grew up in the cities of KÃ³pavogur and HafnarfjÃ¶rÃ°ur. Heâ€™s looking forward to political change after the parliamentary election, confident that people have had enough of the parties currently in power. â€œSince this government came in in 2013, thereâ€™s been a lot of active resentment against it. Although it was no small drop of news, the Panama Papers scandal was the thing that pushed it over the edge. Iâ€™m personally hoping to see the Pirate Party, left greens, social democrats and bright future form a government. I think trust can be restored in Iceland if the right people get in. â€ As a high school student in Reykjavik this will be the first time Kjartan SkarphÃ©Ã°insson has had a chance to vote in an election. But having three family members involved in three different political parties, heâ€™s always been very interested in Icelandic politics. â€œMost people I know are excited about the election. There have been plenty of conversations recently that eventually turn to the election and who people are planning to vote for. Weâ€™ll hopefully get a lot of new blood in and get rid of the current government. â€ While the radical Pirate Party looks set to have a good election, Kjartan is still cautious about writing off the parties currently in power, despite the Panama Paper revelations and accusations of cronyism. â€œI think people who have traditionally voted for the parties in power are apathetic. They know about the corruption going on but still see the current government as a better alternative than the inexperienced Pirate Party or the traditionally disliked establishment parties that lead during the recession and thus had to make some large cuts. There is also a big difference between the voting demographics in the countryside and the cities. â€ Galdur was born and raised in Iceland and works as an IT professional. He has seldom seen a more indecisive mood in the country ahead of an election: â€œIâ€™m not sure who Iâ€™m voting for yet, but it will definitely be an opposition party. The ruling parties have both been implicated in the Panama Papers and that has tainted their integrity and peopleâ€™s trust towards them. Their poor results in the polls, despite an upturn in our economy, arenâ€™t surprising. â€ Despite the uncertainty among people, Galdur believes the media coverage leading up to the election has been excellent. â€œI think RÃšV, the state TV station, and other outlets are doing a good job providing all the parties with air time and giving them a fair chance to present their case to the public. â€ Whoever wins the parliamentary election, Galdur is clear about what he wants to see from a new government. â€œThe tax system needs to be fairer the highest earners having to contribute more. There needs to be more funds channeled into our health system and also towards improving our roads and tourist attractions. Above all, the blatant cronyism needs to stop the appointment of friends and relatives, allowing the sale of high profit companies and properties to friends and family, lowering taxes for the rich while putting higher burdens on the low and middle classes. It all needs to stop. We need more integrity. â€ Axel works for the government and is predicting real change after Saturdayâ€™s election. â€œThe four establishment parties are facing their worst electoral outcomes ever. We have three new parties that could grab as much as 40% of the vote. There is a fairly strong sentiment among voters to show their dissatisfaction with the political establishment. This sentiment is far stronger now than in the wake of the economic crash back in 2008. â€ With the current coalition partners, the Independence Party and the Progressive Party, not going to win enough seats to continue in government, Axel thinks other parties will get a chance to form a coalition. â€œIcelandic politicians needs to distance themselves entirely from special interests and convince their voters that they are first and foremost focused on the publicâ€™s interest. Politicians also need to introduce more transparency at all levels of government. Increased opportunities for the public to exert a greater political influence will empower the people and make them feel like they can rein in the politicians. â€ Runar was born and raised in the village of Seydisfjordur on Icelandâ€™s east coast. He works as a team leader in the local fish processing plant. â€œThe fishing industry is still strong, but thereâ€™s some uncertainty about what will happen after the election. The rightwing politicians want to keep the industry more or less the same, but the parties on the left want to make radical changes. Some of the biggest companies in fishing are benefactors of the Independence party. â€ Runar hopes there will be a political change that can benefit both his own industry and regain peopleâ€™s trust in the countryâ€™s politicians. â€œI donâ€™t think thereâ€™s apathy towards politics in Iceland. You canâ€™t turn on the radio or TV without being bombarded by election news. People seem to be interested, but I suppose the turnout will show us how interested they really are. There is a certain level of animosity towards the politicians that were found out to be involved in the Panama Papers scandal. People are not happy to be in financial quarantine themselves, while at the same time observing politicians stashing money offshore. Whoever is elected also needs to look at a health system that is in tatters and ensure that everyone has equal access to it. â€ Matt currently works in the Icelandic public sector and lives in Reykjavik. â€œThe mood in Iceland is interesting. Itâ€™s been a much shorter campaign cycle this time round than last time in April 2013, mostly because everyone knew those elections were coming well in advance. â€ Matt believes thereâ€™s plenty of interest among the public and that the coverage of the elections has gone far to ignite this. â€œThereâ€™s been regular television debates, often with anything up to ten or 12 participants, and regular opinion polls dominating the front pages. The mood is not one of apathy, but I would say there are a lot of people still undecided where their vote will go. â€ Matt believes there are different outcomes that can realistically happen once the votes have been counted. â€œThe Pirate Party might get a shot at governing, people might stick with whom they know and ignore the recent scandals, or another party altogether might have a late surge of support. A coalition looks simply unworkable. I donâ€™t see how they could all work in government or in coalition. The best option would be a government of just the three with the most seats. I would reckon that will be Pirates, Left Greens and either Social Democrats or Bright Future. â€ Whichever way the vote goes Matt echoes other peopleâ€™s feelings about the cronyism in Icelandic politics. â€œPolticians need to show a bit more humility, show respect to the office they hold and the trust the people have given them. Just this week weâ€™ve had reports of both the Foreign Minister and the Agriculture and Fisheries Minister appointing their advisors to the boards of public bodies. Itâ€™s this sort of cronyism that pollutes our politics. â€",0
"261","https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/sep/24/hillary-clinton-endorsement-new-york-times-donald-trump-elizabeth-warren","Martin Pengelly","As Hillary Clinton prepared for the first presidential debate against Donald Trump on Monday, campaign surrogates spoke in swing states and the New York Times published a strongly worded endorsement of the former secretary of state. The Timesâ€™ editorial board said that as first lady, senator for New York and secretary of state, Clinton had shown herself to be â€œone of the most tenacious politicians of her generationâ€ capable of fostering bipartisan cooperation. It also called Trump â€œthe worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American historyâ€. In New Hampshire, where, according to the Real Clear Politics average, Clinton holds a 44% to 38% lead, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren accused Trump and the Republican party of â€œmaking hate OKâ€. In Ohio, where Trump leads by 45% to 42% cast members from the 1990s TV show The West Wing, which portrayed an imaginary Democratic administration, hit the stump for Clinton. Echoing concerns among Democrats about motivating voters, particularly the young, to vote for a candidate who has struggled to generate campaign momentum, the Timesâ€™ editorial board argued that Trumpâ€™s negative qualities were not enough to merit an endorsement of Clinton. â€œRunning down the other guy wonâ€™t suffice,â€ wrote the board, which is separate from the newsroom. â€œThe best case for Hillary Clinton cannot be, and is not, that she isnâ€™t Donald Trump. The best case is, instead, about the challenges this country faces, and Mrs Clintonâ€™s capacity to rise to them. â€œA lifetimeâ€™s commitment to solving problems in the real world qualifies Hillary Clinton for this job, and the country should put her to work,â€ the editorial board added. Addressing Clintonâ€™s poor poll ratings regarding trust and favourability, it said: â€œMrs Clintonâ€™s occasional missteps, combined with attacks on her trustworthiness, have distorted perceptions of her character. â€œShe is one of the most tenacious politicians of her generation, whose willingness to study and correct course is rare in an age of unyielding partisanship. â€ Grouping as examples the rise of Trump, the Brexit vote for Britain to leave the European Union, the spread of Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and the resurgence of Russia under Vladimir Putin, the Times said the next president would take office â€œwith bigoted, tribalist movements and their leaders on the marchâ€. It added: â€œWar, terrorism and the pressures of globalization are eroding democratic values, fraying alliances and challenging the ideals of tolerance and charity. â€ Regarding the candidateâ€™s battles with the press over her use of a private email server while secretary of state, which flared up again on Friday with the release of FBI notes and the news a judge had ruled some such emails must be released to the public before election day, the Times said: â€œThat decision deserved scrutiny, and itâ€™s had it. â€œNow, considered alongside the real challenges that will occupy the next president, that email server, which has consumed so much of this campaign, looks like a matter for the help desk. â€œAnd, viewed against those challenges, Mr Trump shrinks to his true proportions, as weâ€™ll argue in detail on Monday. â€ The paper promised a scathing perspective on Trump for Monday, saying he is â€œthe worst nominee put forward by a major party in modern American historyâ€. In a preview, the Times said the Republican candidate â€œdiscloses nothing concrete about himself or his plans while promising the moon and offering the stars on layawayâ€. On the campaign trail in Nashua, Warren spoke to volunteers at a Clinton campaign office. â€œWeâ€™re here to say hate is not OK,â€ she said. â€œWe build a stronger America together â€” thatâ€™s what this is about. â€ Warren was scheduled to make three stops in the state, where a Senate contest between incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte and Democratic governor Maggie Hassan remains close. Warren sought to tie Ayotte to Trump â€” the senator has said she would â€œstand upâ€ to Trump but nonetheless vote for him â€” saying she had not thought a major presidential candidate would base a campaign on scapegoating Mexicans, women and Muslims. â€œWhat Donald Trump is doing is not what any of us thought a man whoâ€™s running for president would do,â€ she said. â€œHeâ€™s found something much uglier that he wants to make the basis of his campaign. â€ Warren was also critical of the Texas senator Ted Cruz, who on Friday said he would vote for Trump despite having denounced him, while they were primary rivals, for Trumpâ€™s personal attacks against the senatorâ€™s wife and father. In July, Cruz refused to endorse Trump in a speech to the Republican convention, earning boos, then explained his speech by saying he was not a â€œservile puppyâ€. Explaining his decision in a statement posted to Facebook on Friday, Cruz said: â€œEven though I have had areas of significant disagreement with our nominee, by any measure Hillary Clinton is wholly unacceptable. â€ On Saturday, Warren asked: â€œIs that really what your word is worth, Ted Cruz?â€",0
"262","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/16/obama-refugees-increase-proposal-us-capable-resettling","Aryeh Neier","Barack Obamaâ€™s announcement that the United States proposes to admit 110, 000 refugees over the course of the next year has elicited a furious reaction from some Republican leaders. This was predictable. A spirit of xenophobia has once again taken hold in the United States, as has happened on several previous occasions in American history. As early as 1798, just a few years after the establishment of the Republic, Congress adopted a Naturalization law that was intended to keep out radicals who could promote sedition. The main targets were the French, who might spread the â€œJacobinâ€ ideology of the French Revolution. In the 19th century, a focus of exclusion was the Chinese who were explicitly kept out under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. That law was not repealed until 1943, when it became embarrassing because China was an ally of the United States in the war against Japan. In the early part of the 20th century, a number of measures were adopted to limit the admission of southern Europeans, such as the Italians, ostensibly because they were thought to be more likely to spread the anarchist ideology than immigrants from northern Europe. And so things have gone. Today, of course, the main focus of those denouncing Obamaâ€™s proposal is Syrian refugees. Up to now, the United States has admitted a few more than 10, 000. So far, at least, their resettlement in the United States has seemed to go very well, though Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Donald Trumpâ€™s running mate, has tried to keep them out of his state. Additional refugees from Syria would constitute a minority of those that Obama proposes to admit over the next year. The number projected for all countries in the Middle East and South Asia is 40, 000. Yet in this election year, in which the Republican nominee for president swept aside his opponents for the nomination by saying he would deport 11 million undocumented immigrants from Mexico, and he would bar all Muslims from entering the United States, has made xenophobia look like a winning political strategy. As should be apparent, a wealthy country of 320 million people can easily absorb 110, 000 refugees. In the year that ends 30 September, Americaâ€™s goal has been 85, 000 refugees. The increase is modest given the scale of the global refugee crisis. It compares poorly to neighboring Canada, with a population just over ten percent of the United States. In the brief period between 15 November 2015 and 29 February 2016, Canada admitted 25, 000 Syrian refugees, as well as many refugees from other countries. As Canadaâ€™s highly popular Prime Minister Justin Trudeau does not have political opponents trying to win office by exploiting xenophobia, the absorption of the Syrian refugees has been accepted not only approvingly but enthusiastically by the great majority of Canadians. A large number of the refugees have been sponsored by Canadian church groups, associations and other organizations that have paid the initial costs of resettlement, and helped the refugees to find homes, learn English, get jobs and get their children into schools. Canada carefully screens refugees accepted for resettlement. So does the United States. Typically, the American screening program for refugees lasts more than a year. That is possible when an orderly program is established. It is one of the reasons that a refugee program such as that conducted by Canada, and the one under which the United States admitted 10, 000 Syrian refugees in the past year, tends to succeed. I donâ€™t think Americans are inherently more xenophobic than their Canadian neighbors. In such matters, as in much else, political opportunism plays a big role. It seems to bring out the worst in many people, including those denouncing the presidentâ€™s modest proposal.",0

Stephen Curry scored a 36 points to spark the Warriors, who trailed by as many as 13 during the first half but used a run in the third quarter to open an lead entering the fourth. His Golden State Klay Thompson added 21 points and six to follow up his performance in Game 6 on Saturday, when the Warriors needed a furious rally to force Mondayâ€™s finale. Golden State become the 10th team in NBA history to rally from a deficit in postseason series and win it. â€œThis may be the greatest team in the history of the NBA,â€ Thunder coach Billy Donovan said afterward. â€œThey do things like make big shots and do some of those things. We were right there every step of the way with them, and this was a team and world champions.

It might be that it was a little bit of both. The history was not in the Thunderâ€™s favor. teams were in home Game 7s, according to ESPN. There have been 36 teams to lose Game 6 at home with a series lead. Of those, less than half came back to win Game 7. But more than that, Russell Westbrook was off his game, shooting for from the floor on Monday night. Kevin Durant shot for a total of 27 points, his Game 7 performance ever. â€œWe laid it all out there,â€ a somber Durant said. â€œEverybody left their soul out on the court. We have no regrets. â€ Warriors coach Steve Kerr said beforehand he was going to make â€œ11 alterations to the gameplanâ€ one of which was starting Andre Iguodala after a strong showing in Game 6 instead of Harrison Barnes. Iguodala added seven points and was aggressive on defense. Saturdayâ€™s Game 6 appeared to be the beginning of the end for the Thunderâ€™s charmed postseason as Oklahoma City blew yet another lead in the fourth quarter. The Thunder were notorious for squandering leads in the final minutes of games. At one point their number of collapses were worse than the Philadelphia 76ers, one of the worst teams in the league this year. There is also plenty of speculation about the future of Durant, who will soon be a free agent. A player of his talents could easily make over $100m on a new contract. But Durant, understandably, did not want to discuss such matters on Monday night. â€œI mean, we just lost like 30 minutes ago, so I havenâ€™t even thought about it,â€ Durant said. â€œIâ€™m just embracing my and just reflecting on the season. Iâ€™ll think about that stuff, I donâ€™t know when. But we just lost an hour ago, 30 minutes ago, so I donâ€™t know. â€ Bay Area natives Andy Samberg and were seen in the Oracle Arena crowd, as was Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who arrived at after campaigning in northern California. Now the Cleveland Cavaliers will head to California for a much anticipated rematch of last yearâ€™s NBA finals, which the Warriors won in six games. Game 1 is Thursday in Oakland.",0
"264","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/babies-breastfed-within-hour-birth-less-likely-die","France BÃ©gin","What happens in an hour can make all the difference. When I had my first baby, the support I received from my nurse was indispensable in helping me initiate and continue breastfeeding. It may not be obvious, but putting newborns to the breast within the first hour of life can make the difference between life and death. Delaying the start of breastfeeding beyond one hour after birth can raise a newborns risk of dying by 80% compared to those who are breastfed immediately. Newborns now account for nearly half of all deaths of children under five. Early breastfeeding plays a critical part in reducing newborn mortality and keeping babies healthy. But are we doing everything possible to make that happen? It turns out weâ€™re not. New research from Unicef shows that more than half of all newborns are not breastfed within one hour of birth. That means that 77 million newborns â€” over 50% of babies born each year are losing out on the benefits of early initiation, exposing them to a higher risk of disease and death. This is happening because women are not getting the support they need around the time of birth, even when a doctor, nurse or midwife is assisting their delivery. Globally, more than three quarters of all mothers give birth with the help of a skilled birth attendant. But in many hospitals, rather than initiating the practice of breastfeeding by immediately placing a newborn on the motherâ€™s chest, attendants will take the baby away to give the mother time to rest or feed the newborn formula. In the Middle East, North Africa and in South Asia, women who deliver with a skilled birth attendant are less likely to initiate breastfeeding in the first hour of life, compared to women who deliver with unskilled attendants or relatives. When babies are given alternatives to breastmilk, they breastfeed less often, making it harder for mothers to start and continue breastfeeding. In some countries, the rise in caesarean deliveries has reduced this crucial practice and delayed breastfeeding initiation however, with the right support, even most newborns delivered by Caesarean section can be put to the breast within the first hour of life. Traditional practices also interfere with getting an early start to breastfeeding, depriving newborns of the essential nutrients, antibodies and contact with their mother that protect them from disease and death. In India, some women are taught to discard colostrum â€” the breast milk a mother produces right after birth. In Nigeria, some newborns are given water or tea in lieu of breast milk, putting them at risk of diarrhea and malnutrition. Countries in other parts of the world are inundated with formula marketing, which has led to plummeting breastfeeding rates. Placing newborns on their motherâ€™s bare chest â€” known as contact â€” immediately after birth helps reduce mortality by regulating a babyâ€™s heart rate, temperature and breathing, while also facilitating breastfeeding. Not only that, exposure to the bacteria on the motherâ€™s breast helps to colonize a newbornâ€™s digestive system with essential antibodies. Immediate contact promotes bonding between newborn and mother and ensures that babies receive the nurturing they need from the very first moments they enter the world. And mothers practicing early contact and early initiation of breastfeeding with their newborns are more likely to produce sufficient milk, breastfeed within the first months of their babyâ€™s life, and continue breastfeeding longer â€” a practice proven to improve health outcomes for both children and mothers. The Lancet reported earlier this year that breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months could save more than 800, 000 childrenâ€™s lives each year because it acts as a babyâ€™s first vaccine, protecting infants from diseases, and giving them a perfectly adapted nutritional supply they need at each developmental stage. This amounts to a 13% reduction in the deaths of children under five and also supports healthy brain development, increased IQ scores and better school performance for all children. Breastfeeding is a powerful intervention â€” itâ€™s backed by research and doesnâ€™t require preparation or expensive new medications. Breastfeeding has incredible developmental benefits, and, in areas that lack access to clean environment and clean water to mix with formula powder, saves babies from diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. To be sure, there are many barriers to breastfeeding we must work to overcome so mothers who want to breastfeed are able to, and there are a small number of mothers for whom breastfeeding isnâ€™t an option. But to serve millions of mothers and children better, one simple and important thing we can do now is support early initiation of breastfeeding. Providing new mothers with guidance on initiating breastfeeding, not supplying any liquids or foods other than breastmilk and ensuring that staff are appropriately trained are all simple adjustments that can help a woman breastfeed successfully. Given what research has taught us about the importance of early initiation, we have countless reasons to do everything possible to increase rates globally â€” especially when solutions come at little to no extra cost.",0
"265","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/27/pokemon-go-tricks-pro-players-exploits-cheats-eevee-vaporeon","Samuel Gibbs","Once youâ€™ve mastered the basics of PokÃ©mon Go, advanced to curve balls and tried your luck in gyms, itâ€™s time to turn it up a notch and start exploiting the game to boost your chances of being a champion. Thereâ€™s nothing illegal about these tips, but some may find them unsporting. Others rely on them to get an edge over their competitors. Here are five tips to help give you a boost. Increasing the level of your trainer is crucial to get access to both higher level PokÃ©mon and the tools to catch them. Above level 20 you gain access to Ultra balls, which make life a lot easier when trying to keep hold of the rarer beasts. Levelling up can be a bit of a slow grind, but Pidgey stacking can boost your trainer by at least one level. Itâ€™s pretty simple. All you need are lots of Pidgey and a lucky egg. Low powered Pidgey are plentiful in most places and require only 12 candies to evolve into Pidgeotto, an act that normally gives you 500XP. With a lucky egg active, which doubles your XP for 30 minutes that becomes 1, 000XP per evolution. By collecting loads of them and evolving as many as possible in 30 minutes with a lucky egg you can set somewhere in the region of 30, 000 to 40, 000XP at full burn with a strong internet connection. At lower levels thatâ€™s enough to jump at least one, possibly two levels. After youâ€™re done with all the Pidgey, just trade in the resulting Pidgeotto to start collecting candies to do it again. You can use any PokÃ©mon that can evolve, of course, but Pidgey is the most candy efficient given its abundance. Not all PokÃ©mon are created equally, that much is obvious. But what you might not know is that two PokÃ©mon of the same type and level are also not equal. Each monster has a series of hidden values that dictate how much HP and CP it has per level, as well as its secret energy rating, which determines how long it takes for the special attack energy bar to fill up. These individual values (IVs) cannot be directly interrogated, but using some calculations based on the health and power of a particular PokÃ©mon for its given level, you can infer them. By doing so you can work out which PokÃ©mon are worth spending time improving using stardust and evolution candy and which are not. When you get to a high level with your trainer, these IVs can make around a % in both HP and CP, which when your PokÃ©mon are maxed out, could mean the difference between beating rivals and losing battles in the gym. There are several ways to use IVs, with the simplest being to compare PokÃ©mon of a same type and similar level to see which has the higher CP and HP values. But for those that want to take it further, an IV calculator is required. The best is arguably that created by Reddit PokÃ©mon Go community, the Silph Road, which has been conducting research into various attributes of PokÃ©mon Go. The IV rater allows you to quickly estimate how good your PokÃ©mon can be, and whether it is worth hanging on to, simply by moving some sliders. There are others, including an IV calculator app for Android, although they may or may not be accurate they are worth using if youâ€™re serious about trying to take over and hold gyms as you reach the highest trainer levels. One of the more powerful and easier to get PokÃ©mon in the game are the evolved forms of Eevee, but unlike most other beasts in the game, Eevee has three different evolved forms in PokÃ©mon Go. Eevee can become the Flareon, the Jolteon or the Vaporeon. Theyâ€™re all solid in their own ways, with some being more effective in certain situations than others. But the most powerful for both attack and defence of the lot is Vaporeon. To choose, rather than have Eevee randomly evolve into one of them, you have to rename your Eevee after one of the Eevee brothers from the PokÃ©mon TV show before evolving it. Calling it Pyro spawns a Flareon, while Sparky becomes a Jolteon and Rainer a Vaporeon. Rename Eevee, hit save and then reload the PokÃ©mon Go app just to make sure the name saved. Then evolve the renamed Eevee to net yourself your desired PokÃ©mon. This should work at least once, but your milage may vary. Make sure you check out the IVs of the Eevee youâ€™re planning to evolve to make sure youâ€™ve got a one before using all your candy. Hatching eggs is one of the best ways to get powerful PokÃ©mon, but if you donâ€™t walk for your commute or in your general day, it can be hard to clock up the kilometres required to incubate them. You might find, however, that if you leave your smartphone plugged in and on a desk, that your location wanders around, enough to add up to half a kilometre a day to your walking total in my testing depending on how accurate the smartphone can put your location. Every little helps, particularly if you donâ€™t have a drone to hand. Once youâ€™ve caught your 100th Pidgey, unless youâ€™re Pidgey stacking, youâ€™re probably after some of the more rare PokÃ©mon. You could aimlessly wander the streets or rely on word of mouth, but if youâ€™re less keen on clocking up the kilometres, thereâ€™s a better way. Various maps or radar apps have popped up that promise to show where PokÃ©mon are and for how long at any given moment. Having tested PokÃ©vision, Iâ€™ve found it accurate on over 10 occasions for various PokÃ©mon. Putting in your location and searching will bring up all the PokÃ©mon around you, but you can narrow down your search to specific PokÃ©mon and search a much wider area. You still have to put the leg work into getting there before the timer runs out, but PokÃ©vision, and others like it, should help take the guess work out of catching the less common varieties of PokÃ©mon.",0
"266","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/05/donald-trump-week-campaign-turning-point-2016-election","Richard Wolffe","What have you accomplished this week? Whatever it is, you donâ€™t come close to Donald Trump. Trump has demolished his campaign, his brand and his party. He has squandered his pick and his convention, and several battleground states along with them. He picked several fights he could not win, and showed no sign of learning from his own failure. It would be tempting to say this was just another week in the bizarre life of the Republican presidential nominee. But it wasnâ€™t. This week was a decisive turning point in the 2016 election, and there have been remarkably few of them in an campaign that is supposedly volatile. In fact, the volatility and unpredictability of this election doesnâ€™t come from polls or votes, but from the character of a single man: Donald J Trump. The real surprise of 2016 is how constant this contest has been. Trump led the primary polls from the beginning and never lost his lead. He only surprised the chattering classes by defying their certainty that he would lose. That certainty was founded on nothing related to polling data, but rather their sheer disgust and disbelief with Trumpâ€™s politics. Having defied expectations once, Trump is now supposed to be able to defy polling gravity forever more. That would be a strange conclusion to draw from the primaries, but here we are. Echoing the Trump campaign, the Fox News anchor Greta van Susteren distilled this position on Thursday, as she quizzed the Karl Rove. â€œI see the rallies and theyâ€™re big, and I see the poll numbers, and heâ€™s slipping in the polls,â€ she said. â€œIâ€™m not so sure how accurate these polls are. â€ Rove â€” the man who challenged the Fox News election desk as it called the 2012 election for Obama â€” was incredulous. â€œYouâ€™re assuming first of all, the polls are not reliable â€” all of them â€” and second of all, that a better test of this is the size of the crowds he gets at his rallies, which are big and enthusiastic,â€ he explained. â€œBut I would remind you in the closing days in the 1984 presidential campaign, Walter Mondale was drawing large and enthusiastic rallies as he went on to narrowly win one state. â€ To put it delicately, this is a difficult moment in the education of Donald Trump. For a candidate who leads every stump speech bragging about his poll numbers, there is less and less material every day. Ergo the polls â€” just like the media, Clinton and democracy itself â€” must be crooked. It would be nice to call this a logical fallacy, but those are two words that should never be placed within physical proximity of Donald J Trump. â€œI see some great polls,â€ he told a rally in Virginia on Tuesday. â€œI see one from the Los Angeles Times, just came out, where weâ€™re ahead by four or five points. I see one from CNN where weâ€™re down. I think these polls, I donâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s something about these polls. Thereâ€™s something phony. â€ That was the day after he told voters there was an even bigger problem with this confounding election. â€œIâ€™m afraid the electionâ€™s going to be rigged,â€ he told voters in Ohio. â€œI have to be honest. â€ Those who live in the world are having an easier time understanding Trumpâ€™s challenges. The simpler explanation is that he is losing because of his own performance and personality. As the saying goes, campaigns are like fish: they rot from the head down. This one stinks already and itâ€™s only the start of August. Barack Obama put it more diplomatically at his press conference. â€œIf Mr Trump is up 10 or 15 points on election day and he ends up losing, then, you know, maybe he can raise some questions,â€ Obama ventured. â€œThat doesnâ€™t seem to be the case at the moment. â€ No, it doesnâ€™t. In any campaign cycle, there are periods when the dynamic turns decisively in one direction. While the dynamic can shift more than once, as the cycle runs its course there are fewer and fewer opportunities to do so. George HW Bush engineered one of those shifts after his 1988 convention, turning a deficit into an lead, backed up by devastating TV ads. Bill Clinton enjoyed one of those shifts in 1992 when Ross Perot initially dropped out of the race, and Clinton never really lost his lead again. In 2004, John Kerry staged a decent convention and held a narrow lead, but was soon destroyed by a better Republican convention and the attacks that followed. Four years later, Barack Obama didnâ€™t bury John McCain until the financial collapse that followed both conventions. How does the past week of 2016 compare to those moments in recent presidential history? Pretty favorably. Trump miserably misjudged his dispute with the gold star parents of a fallen American soldier, Humayun Khan, who was Muslim. He drove a wedge between himself and the few Republican leaders who publicly tolerated his nomination. And he seriously undermined his own brand of patriotic nationalism, as well as his partyâ€™s reputation for strength on national security. The lasting impact of Trumpâ€™s disastrous week came from its echoes of the Democratic convention. Each round of dispute with the Khan family only served to reinforce the criticism that he had sacrificed nothing. Each response underscored Hillary Clintonâ€™s attack on his temperament and qualifications to serve as . In the middle of his own circular firing squad, Trump decided to shoot at the one unifying Republican who has politely ignored his insanity: House speaker Paul Ryan. Trumpâ€™s support for Ryanâ€™s primary opponent was â€” like the construction of so many hideous Trump Towers â€” wholly unnecessary. Ryanâ€™s response was to send out a fundraising email assuming Trump had already blown this election. â€œIf we fail to protect our majority in Congress, we could be handing President Hillary Clinton a blank check,â€ the fundraiser said, echoing the congressional Republican partyâ€™s abandonment of Bob Dole in the closing weeks of the 1996 election. Of course, these arenâ€™t the closing weeks of the 2016 campaign. Trump could yet turn around his national polling deficit of up to 14 points. He could flip the polls in Florida (down four) Michigan (down nine) Pennsylvania (down 13) and New Hampshire (down 15). He could turn Georgia and Utah back into reliably Republican states again, instead of being states. But Trump only has one shot left to do that: the TV debates that start in another seven weeks. At the same time, history suggests that polling is remarkably stable stretching all the way into the final days of an election. Itâ€™s going to be a long, hot summer for the orange one.",0
"267","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/24/bmx-dave-mirra-brain-trauma-disease-cte","Guardian sport","Dave Mirra, the BMX icon who killed himself in February aged 41, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the chronic brain disease that has been found in dozens of former NFL players, a University of Toronto doctor has concluded. Several other neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis, according to ESPN. Mirra is the first BMX rider to be diagnosed with CTE, a disease tied to repeated brain trauma and associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. Mirra was found dead in Greenville, South Carolina on 4 February from a gunshot wound. The tau protein deposits found in Mirraâ€™s brain were indistinguishable from the kind that have been found in the brains of former football and hockey players with CTE, Dr Hazrati, the Toronto neuropathologist, told ESPN The Magazine. â€œI couldnâ€™t tell the difference,â€ she said. â€œThe trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma. Itâ€™s assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before. â€ Mirra, a BMX legend who won numerous X Games gold medals, fractured his skull when a car hit him at age 19, and he tried boxing after his retirement from BMX. But he also endured countless concussions during a glittering career. Many in BMX have shared their concerns over the effects of the concussions most riders have sustained at some point in their career. Hazrati shared her findings on Mirraâ€™s brain with additional US and Canadian neuropathologists. Each confirmed Hazratiâ€™s diagnosis of CTE. â€œIt validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players,â€ Hazrati said. â€œThe key is brain injury. Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this. â€ Mirraâ€™s wife Lauren was told of Mirraâ€™s CTE in March. She told ESPN how she noticed his personality change in the last year of his life. â€œI started to notice changes in his mood. And then it quickly started to get worse,â€ she said. â€œHe wasnâ€™t able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, â€˜Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?â€™ â€œThis is the beginning of bringing awareness. It would be amazing if this is something we can detect in life one day. If we can detect it, prevent it, stop it, letâ€™s do all of the above. â€ Mirra will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in Chula Vista, California, on 11 June. He will also be honored during this Juneâ€™s X Games in Austin, Texas, with a new event named for him, the Dave Mirra BMX Park Best Trick competition. The winner will be awarded the Mirra Golden Pedal and prize money. ESPN owns and produces the X Games, which had no comment on Mirraâ€™s diagnosis.",0

After yet another easily avoidable televised blunder in which the Libertarian presidential candidate failed to name even one leader of a foreign country that he was fond of, itâ€™s a fair question. If, by some miracle, Johnson were able to cobble together enough support to reach the 15% threshold to qualify for the debates, that would be the only question I would want answered. Just two minutes of Johnson rattling off things he does know. How many eggs in a dozen? Thatâ€™s a snap, Anderson. Itâ€™s 12. Where are babies made, Mr Johnson? Well . .. something about mommies and daddies loving each other, right? Who let the dogs out? Wow, thatâ€™s a tough one, Anderson. Can I get back to you after I consult with my advisors? I happen to be heavily courting the dogcatchersâ€™ union. Better yet, this could make a remarkable game show for those lonely summer months when the American broadcast networks air human dart tossing and Family Feud. Iâ€™m certain that Are You Smarter Than Gary Johnson would be a smash hit on Fox or The CW. Corral some and see if they can spot China on a map before Gary. If one of the schoolchildren is successful, they get to debate Trump and Clinton in his place. If you think itâ€™s scary that a presidential candidate polling around 8% nationally canâ€™t identify the name of the city undergoing one of the most horrendous humanitarian crises of the last 30 years and is incapable of recalling any of Americaâ€™s numerous foreign allies, you are not alone. If you see my hypothetical game show in which prepubescent moppets are more aware of global affairs than Gary Johnson, remember we have a game show host running for president. Donald Trump, a man who is happy to admit he doesnâ€™t read, may become our . If he does, these â€œAleppo momentsâ€ will become a daily fixture in our lives. What does Donald Trump know about the European Union besides cheeky Brexit slogans, twit Boris Johnson and where the nearest former Soviet bloc beauty pageant is? Oh right, he doesnâ€™t even know that Belgium is a country, not a city. Why, then, does the media treat Gary Johnson with indifference mixed with condescension while happily cutting into regularly scheduled programming in order to broadcast Trumpâ€™s announcement that after eight years, he can finally accept all the clear evidence that Barack Obama was born in the United States? It should give us all pause that Gary Johnson and Donald Trump, while a great distance apart in the charisma department, are equally as unqualified to be president. In the most terrifying election of my lifetime, we must face the system weâ€™ve created. Itâ€™s one that rewards sloganeering, platitudes and retweets. Itâ€™s one where regurgitating promises â€” lower taxes, crushing Isis, legal weed! â€” is all one needs to rally voters. Everything Clintonites accused Bernie Sanders of â€” ideas, lack of foreign policy experience simple solutions to complex problems â€” is actually true of Johnson and Trump. And thereâ€™s also Jill Stein, whose campaign currently consists of reminders that sheâ€™s sort of like Bernie Sanders, complete with her own stash of â€œdank memesâ€. A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a man who has proven on more than one occasion that he knows very little about the rest of the world, who gets indignant when he is challenged on that fact and who has seemingly made no effort to close this knowledge gap. A vote for Gary Johnson is a vote for a less hateful Donald Trump â€” a man who looks more like a game show contestant than a game show host. If thatâ€™s what youâ€™re looking for in this election, then youâ€™re in luck. If you are, then my one question to you is: why?",0
"269","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/02/elon-musk-self-driving-tesla-autopilot-joshua-brown-risks","Sam Levin","Elon Muskâ€™s rockets usually do not stray beyond Earthâ€™s orbit, but that hasnâ€™t stopped him from making promises about Mars. The Tesla CEOâ€™s wild, ambitious futurism has earned him billions of dollars, fawning coverage from the tech press, and a subreddit devoted entirely to discussion of his divinity. But it has also now landed him and his company in the awkward position of explaining why a feature they called â€œautopilotâ€ should not be to blame for failing to prevent one of their vehicles from driving under a truck in May, killing Joshua Brown â€” the first known fatality involving a car. Brown was a Tesla enthusiast with a â€œneed for speedâ€ according to reports by the Associated Press. He had previously posted a video to YouTube of the vehicle avoiding an accident while in autopilot mode, which Musk retweeted. In a blog post on Thursday about the incident, Tesla said: â€œNeither Autopilot nor the driver noticed the white side of the tractor trailer against a brightly lit sky, so the brake was not applied. â€ The driver of the truck told the AP that he heard a Harry Potter movie being played from the wreck of the car, and the Florida sheriffâ€™s department confirmed that a portable DVD player was found in the car, though it is still not known whether Brown was watching a film at the time of the crash. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the accident. Since Tesla launched Autopilotâ€™s enhanced cruise control features in October 2014 â€” and especially since Autopilot was updated to include capability in October 2015 â€” the company has been careful to stress that drivers remain responsible â€” and liable â€” for any collisions. The company pointed out that this was the first fatal accident in 130m miles driven by all Tesla cars under the control of the autopilot feature, compared with a US average of one fatality every 94m miles. It also pointed out that autopilot is still in a â€œpublic betaâ€ phase. But other companies have chosen more conservative descriptions for their assisted cruise control. Volvo calls its current features â€œ techâ€ or â€œpark assist pilotâ€ which analysts say are more accurate descriptors than the â€œautopilotâ€ term Tesla uses. Mercedes calls its package â€œdriver assistanceâ€ and â€œdrive pilotâ€ Toyota has a â€œsafety senseâ€ feature, and Honda calls it â€œsensingâ€. The fine print of the Tesla Model S ownerâ€™s manual includes disclaimers for all manner of conditions and scenarios â€” including heavy rain, snow, fog, and direct sunlight â€” that appear to include the circumstances of the 7 May accident. But in January, just a few months after he chastised drivers for â€œsome fairly crazy videos on YouTubeâ€ of hijinks, Musk told reporters that the Model S was â€œprobably better than humans at this point in highway drivingâ€. Before the updated autopilot was released, he said that the car was â€œalmost able to go [between San Francisco and Seattle] without touching the controls at allâ€. In April, he distracted fans and reporters from the news of a recall of 2, 700 Model X SUVs with a joking tweet comparing autopilot to the video game Mario Kart. Talulah Riley, Muskâ€™s wife, shared and deleted an Instagram video of herself driving on the highway between Los Angeles and San Diego without holding the wheel. Many of Teslaâ€™s current owners are tech enthusiasts who are eager to try out the most vehicles. And when Musk products are presented as the forefront of the â€œautonomous revolutionâ€ the perception of some of those drivers is, â€œIâ€™m already there. Iâ€™m already living it,â€ said Karl Brauer, senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book, an automotive research company. Far from being â€œthereâ€ however, Teslaâ€™s technology is in what Bryant Walker Smith, an assistant professor of law and engineering at the University of South Carolina, called â€œthe â€˜mushy middleâ€™ of the automation spectrumâ€ â€” where driving is increasing in scope but is not yet capable of replacing the driver completely. Smith, who specializes in the legal ramifications of autonomous cars, said that this middle ground has unique dangers: â€œThe difficulty comes if [issues the computer canâ€™t handle] happen so infrequently. Say it can do 99% but not 100% â€” then people are not ready for the 1%. We see problems of . People get bored, they start texting or watching a DVD. â€ Smith warned against reading too much into this single instance or blaming Tesla, pointing out that there is already â€œcarnageâ€ on American roads which kills 100 people every day. â€œWe donâ€™t know how many of those could have been prevented if those vehicles had automatic braking, or a Tesla Autopilot system. â€ However Brauer said it was time for Musk to shift his messaging to clearly acknowledge the limitations of the cars. â€œThese are not cars. They are driver assist features. Honda and Toyota have been really clear about that from day one . .. It really is important. â€ Brauer said Muskâ€™s colorful remarks about the technology often present an exaggerated and dangerous image of the vehiclesâ€™ capabilities. â€œThereâ€™s been potentially mixed messages between a disclaimer in the car that says youâ€™ve got to be alert the whole time and this thing is being beta tested, and then his comment that the car is probably better than humans. â€ The term â€œautopilotâ€ draws a dangerous link to flying, said Mary â€œMissyâ€ Cummings, a Duke University robotics professor and former military pilot. â€œMost car companies love to equate the driving experience with a cool flying experience â€¦ but they need to step away from that parallel,â€ said Cummings, who has been outspoken about the dangers of cars and the need for tighter restrictions. â€œI get to fly a fighter jet, because Iâ€™m highly trained,â€ she said. â€œThis accident really highlights the fact that people do not understand the capabilities and limitations of these vehicles. â€ For now, the crash makes it clear that Tesla should shut off its autopilot feature for certain driving on freeways, said Cummings. â€œEither fix it or turn it off . .. The car was in a place where the computer was blind. The computer couldnâ€™t see the environment for what it was. â€ Some experts, however, said the reality is that humans often fail to follow safety recommendations and tend to do a poor job at perceiving risk. â€œThatâ€™s not a judgment on any individual. Thatâ€™s human nature. This could be anyone of us,â€ said Don MacKenzie, professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington. Ragunathan Rajkumar, professor at the engineering department of of Carnegie Mellon university, agreed. â€œThe question is whether the humans read, understand, and follow what is said on the screen, which I think most people tend to ignore pretty quickly,â€ he said. â€œThe other issue is that we humans tend to be overconfident with something based on limited experience. â€ He pointed to the video Brown posted, in which the system avoided a collision, as potential evidence that Brown had become â€œoverconfidentâ€ in the systemâ€™s abilities. â€œHe said â€˜this did something good for me, so it will be reliable and good for me in every other contextâ€™. This leap in confidence comes naturally to humans, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean the technology will work in every situation,â€ Rajkumar said. â€œItâ€™s a weakness in how humans think. â€ Representatives for Tesla declined to comment further.",0

The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that CEO Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the companyâ€™s future as quickly as possible. Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people familiar with the matter said this week. Salesforce is in the running, while Disney and Googleâ€™s parent company Alphabet have also been contemplating bids, the sources added. It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment. With Salesforce, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313m average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Streetâ€™s sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Snapchat and Facebookâ€™s Instagram. Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as CEO more than a year ago, has been part of Disneyâ€™s board since 2013. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share. The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO but have been on a steady downward trajectory since.",0

October and November figures were revised to show 19, 000 more jobs added than previously reported. The U. S. economy created 2. 16 million jobs in 2016 with the increase in average hourly earnings rising to 2. 9 percent. â€Obviously the focus (of the market) was more on the revision from last month because if you just look at the headline number it was weaker than expected,â€ said Sireen Harajli, currency strategist at Mizuho. â€But if you look at it overall it essentially is a flat reading, so itâ€™s pretty much in line with data weâ€™re seeing in the U.

The euro fell to a low of $1. 0525, but was still headed for its third straight weekly rise against the greenback. Sterling slipped after two days of gains and ahead of a decision in the next week or two on parliamentâ€™s role in Brexit negotiations, while Mexicoâ€™s peso was boosted by a second straight day of currency intervention from its central bank. A Reuters poll on Friday showed that the dollar is expected to keep strengthening against the euro in the months ahead with investors putting even chances on reaching parity this year. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, was up 0. 7 percent at 101. 92 . DXY. It fell for two straight days after touching a high of 103. 820 Tuesday. The dollar suffered its worst daily percentage drop since July on Thursday after unimpressive U.

S. inflation and unemployment data failed to reverse a downtrend that followed some of the biggest gains on record for Chinaâ€™s yuan. A rise in overnight borrowing costs in Hong Kong helped the offshore yuan to its highest rate against the dollar in nearly two months and the largest rise since its inception in 2010. That in turn triggered on the dollar, which fell to its lowest since Dec. 14 as more investors piled on to the selling. The dollar index . DXY, a measure of the greenback against six world currencies, fell 1. 3 percent to a low of 101. 300. It was the worst percentage loss since Sept. 6. The dollarâ€™s steep dive was the result of investors having to reduce or reverse bets on the greenback as momentum shifted in the market, said Deutsche Bankâ€™s Global Head of FX Strategy Alan Ruskin. â€If youâ€™re looking for any catalyst it was China . .. and it turned into a cascade and into a squeeze in a lot of the favored trades that we started the year with,â€ he said. The dollar was last down 1. 4 percent against the yen and around 1 percent lower versus the euro and Swiss franc. The greenback hit its lowest against the yen since Dec. 14 and lowest against the euro and Swiss franc since Dec. 30. Investors shook off promising data on the U.

U. S. jobless claims fell to a low last week, but that data was countered by a report from payrolls processor ADP showing employment gains were soft in December. That put the dollar back on its lower trajectory after a brief stall following the release of the jobless claims figure as investors refocused attention on Chinaâ€™s strong yuan. â€All weâ€™re seeing is a continuation of the overnight move, which is dollar weakness,â€ said Douglas Borthwick, managing director at Chapdelaine Foreign Exchange. â€Obviously thatâ€™s also helped by the significant intervention by the Chinese overnight.â€ Borthwick also said sentiment was growing among investors that the dollarâ€™s strength has peaked as many return to markets after the Christmas and New Year holidays.

The upbeat outlook comes despite a slight fall in revenue and the anticipated $2. 1 billion profit hit from the withdrawal of the Galaxy Note 7 premium smartphone in October. The guidance points to a more rapid recovery for the mobile business than many analysts had anticipated after one of the biggest product safety failures in tech history, and reflects steady price increases for memory chips. â€Samsung posted solid earnings only with sales of older smartphone models like the S7 after the Note 7â€™s discontinuation,â€ said Kim a fund manager at LS Asset Management. â€This makes me have hopes for the (Galaxy) S8. Should they fare well, I expect Samsung to report record earnings this year.â€ The South Korean technology giant said operating profit was likely 9. 2 trillion won ($7. 8 billion) the highest since the third quarter of 2013 and well above the 8. 2 trillion won tipped by a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate from a survey of 21 analysts. The estimate was also higher than any individual forecast in the survey. The South Korean wonâ€™s recent depreciation may have helped boost profits, some analysts said, as component sales are typically settled in U. S. dollars. The local currency fell 8. 8 percent against the dollar in the fourth quarter. Investors pushed Samsung shares up 43 percent last year, betting the surge in demand for memory chips and organic diode screens for smartphones will more than make up for the Note 7 setback and translate to strong earnings growth. Samsung shares were up 2. 1 percent as of 0038 GMT, outperforming a 0. 3 percent rise for the broader market . The stock briefly traded at a record high of 1. 831 million won on Tuesday. The worldâ€™s biggest maker smartphones, TVs and memory chips will not disclose detailed earnings, including the performance of its individual businesses, until late January. Analysts expect Samsungâ€™s chip division to earn a record of more than 4 trillion won in operating profit in thanks to strong demand from smartphone makers, including major client Apple Inc ( ) and data storage products. The mobile divisionâ€™s quarterly profit is also expected to rebound from the third quarter, when the firm booked the bulk of its Note 7 losses, and post its first annual gain in three years thanks to healthy sales of Galaxy S7 smartphones.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission told French nuclear power company Areva SA ( ) it will publish as early as next week the names of U. S. reactors that contain components from its Le Creusot forge that is suspected of falsifying documents despite the companyâ€™s claim that the information is proprietary. The written notice, dated Dec. 30 and seen by Reuters on Thursday, underscores rising tension between the U. S. nuclear regulatory body and Areva after French authorities opened an investigation last month into decades of alleged forgery relating to the quality of parts produced at the forge and used in power plants around the world. The NRC has investigated whether the suspected falsification of documents poses any risks for U. S. nuclear plants, but has said it has found that the plants are safe. â€At this time, there are no indications of any specific safety concerns for U. S. reactors,â€ NRC spokesman David McIntyre said on Thursday. Still, power advocates, including Greenpeace, have pushed NRC to reveal which U. S. reactors have the components, saying that there could be risks to the public. Areva sent the names of at least nine U. S. reactors with parts from Le Creusot on Dec. 15, but asked the agency not to name them due to proprietary business concerns. The NRCâ€™s letter says the agency is not convinced the information is of competitive value, and will release the names 10 calendar days after receipt of the missive unless Areva challenges it. â€The NRC does not currently have sufficient information to determine that competitive harm would result from releasing this information,â€ the agency said in the letter. A U. S. government source said that Areva has indicated it will not challenge the NRCâ€™s publication of the names, which could occur as early as Tuesday. A U. S. spokesman for Areva did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters has independently identified four of the U. S. reactors that are using components from Le Creusot, a fifth that may contain them, and a sixth that may have them on hand for future installation. All of the owners of the reactors said the components meet their quality standards and their reactors are safe. Florida power company NextEra Energy Inc ( ) said it had one reactor with one component from the Le Creusot forge but did not name the part or the reactor. NextEra owns eight reactors four in Florida, two in Wisconsin, one in New Hampshire and one in Iowa. NextEra spokesman Peter Robbins said the component â€has performed its function for over a decade and been subject to detailed inspections and monitoring, none of which has ever detected any design or performance issues.â€ Minnesota power company Xcel Energy Inc ( ) said some components of the two reactor vessels at its Prairie Island plant were made at Le Creusot in the early 1970s. â€Our testing and inspections are rigorous and have not identified any issues,â€ Colleen Mahoney, an Xcel spokeswoman said. In December, Dominion Resources Inc ( ) said that its Millstone station in Connecticut has had a pressurizer from Le Creusot in service since 2006. Spokesman Ken Holt said at the time that the part is fully operational and will remain so for the life of the plant. In addition, FirstEnergy Corp ( ) said its Beaver Valley reactor in Pennsylvania has steam generators and reactor vessel heads manufactured by Spainâ€™s Equipos Nucleares SA, or ENSA, which may contain some components from Le Creusot. The parts were installed in Unit 1 but will not be installed in Unit 2 for a few years. Another company, Entergy Corp ( ) which is listed on a Greenpeace report as having parts from Le Creusot, would not comment on whether its reactors have parts from the forge, saying it cannot comment on details related to its vendors. There are 99 reactors operating in the United States producing about 20 percent of the nationâ€™s power. The Paris prosecutorâ€™s office opened an investigation in December into Le Creusot alleging forgery, endangerment of lives, and aggravated deception and thousands of documents dating to 1965 were being looked at. Areva said then that it was fully cooperating with the investigation. (Reporting by Timothy Gardner and Scott DiSavino",0

It was the first phase of Obamaâ€™s plan to move as many as 19 prisoners to four countries Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and possibly Italy to shrink Guantanamoâ€™s inmate population as much as possible before the Republican is sworn in on Jan. 20. There were emotional reunions with families at the royal airport in the capital Riyadh, with one man bending down to kiss his sobbing motherâ€™s feet as she cried â€God is great.â€ prisoners now remain at Guantanamo. About 40 will still be left by the time Obama leaves office, meaning that he will be unable to fulfill his longstanding pledge to close the controversial facility at the U. S. naval base in Cuba. Trump has vowed to keep it open and â€load it up with some bad dudes.â€ The four Yemenis, all captured as part of the Afghanistan conflict and held without trial for up to 15 years, were on a U. S. list recommended for transfer. They were sent to Saudi Arabia because the Obama administration has ruled out returning Yemenis to their homeland, which is engulfed in civil war and has an active al Qaeda branch. The men were identified as Mohammed Rajab Sadiq Abu Ghanem, Salem Ahmed Hadi bin Kanad, Abdullah Yehya Yousef and Mohammed Bawazir. Bawazir was among prisoners who protested with a lengthy hunger strike. He was cleared for transfer by an review in 2010 and was about to be sent to the Balkans last January but refused because he wanted to go to a country where he had family, a U. S. official said. Ghanem and Kanad were deemed too risky to release in 2010 but their cases were and both were declared eligible for transfer last year. Shibli was approved for transfer in 2010. FINAL TRANSFERS The Obama administration notified Congress last month of its intention to make up to 19 additional transfers, Reuters has reported. Detainees transferred on Thursday or due to leave in coming days make up the bulk of 23 prisoners declared to be safe for repatriation or resettlement. Despite that, Trump said on Tuesday all of those held at Guantanamo should remain. â€These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield,â€ he tweeted. The White House has dismissed his objections and said transfers from Guantanamo, opened by former President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects rounded up overseas after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, will continue until he takes office. Of the prisoners left at Guantanamo, 10 face charges in military commissions, including alleged plotters of the Sept. 11 attacks. About two dozen have not been charged but have been deemed too dangerous to release. It was unclear whether the four detainees who arrived in Saudi Arabia would be released immediately. Last April, the Islamic kingdom a top U. S. ally accepted nine Yemenis and put them through a rehabilitation program that seeks to reintegrate militants into society. â€The United States coordinated with the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure these transfers took place consistent with appropriate security and humane treatment measures,â€ the Pentagon said in a statement. Obama, who has called Guantanamo a â€recruiting toolâ€ for terrorists, has slowly whittled the number of detainees down from 242 when he took office. Under Bush, the prison came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture. Obamaâ€™s efforts to close the prison have been blocked by mostly Republican opposition in Congress, which has barred him from moving any prisoners to the U. S. mainland.

Since his release Thae Yong Ho, the former North Korean deputy ambassador to London, has spent the first week of the new year speaking on South Korean variety shows, joking with fellow defectors and espousing South Koreaâ€™s line that the North Korean government he once defended is unstable and doomed to fail. In a further propaganda coup for Seoul, the gregarious Thae, newly granted South Korean citizenship following his August defection, is embracing life in the capitalist South as a public figure. On a talk show called â€Now On My Way to Meet Youâ€ which features young, usually female, defectors from the isolated North, a video interview between Thae and a panelist was introduced as a chat with the â€British Thae Yong Hoâ€. The Thae spoke of some of his motivations for switching sides between rivals that remain technically at war since the Korean war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. â€On the day we left the embassy and stepped outside, I told my children, from this moment on, as a father, I am breaking you free from your shackles,â€ Thae said on another show. â€Now itâ€™s up to youâ€. ASSASSINATION FEARS Thae is the official to have fled North Korea for the South since the 1997 defection of Hwang Jong Yop, the brains behind North Koreaâ€™s governing ideology, which combines Marxism with extreme nationalism. By contrast, Hwang made very few public appearances and lived in constant fear of assassination until he was found dead in his bathtub from natural causes 13 years later. His fears were not without some foundation the year he arrived in South Korea another prominent defector, Yi Han Yong, was shot dead by suspected North Korean assassins, and shortly after Hwang died South Korean authorities said they had arrested an agent of Pyongyang who had been planning to kill him. During his years in the South, Hwang was extremely cautious in public. Surrounded by security staff, he was reported to never touch a glass of water put in front of him at an event. â€The fundamental difference is that Thae is just more and arguably less â€ said Michael Madden, a U. S. expert on the North Korean leadership. â€That might be due to Hwangâ€™s background as a philosophy professor and senior ideology official, whereas Thae was more of a schmoozer.â€ Thae, who remains under the protection of South Koreaâ€™s National Intelligence Service (NIS) said he does not fear for his safety in South Korea, and works at an NIS that employs many elite former North Koreans. When Thaeâ€™s defection was announced, the South Korean government said he had fled over dissatisfaction with the rule of Kim Jong Un. But he also had two sons living with him and his wife in London, where one had earned a place at a prestigious college. â€We canâ€™t send our boys back to North Korea,â€ Thae quoted his wife as saying in one recorded interview with a panel show. THAE BE CONTINUED Relations between North and South Korea have been especially strained in recent years, with Seoul making renewed efforts to put pressure on Pyongyangâ€™s diplomatic allies. A spokesman for the NIS told Reuters it could not comment on any official future plans that may involve Thae. There are other North Korean defectors who speak English and have international book deals. Many hail from rural areas bordering China and brought stories of victimhood and escape. Thae, however, is from Pyongyangâ€™s elite, speaks English with a British accent, and is known to be charming, urbane and charismatic. â€Thae has huge potential in terms of being a defector spokesman and icon,â€ said Sokeel Park of LiNK, an organization working with defectors. During an interview with broadcaster MBN, Thae was asked about the difference between North and South Korean TV studios. â€Media control is especially strict. When someone shows up at a studio, questions and answers are agreed upon in advance, and a few practice sessions are filmed before the whole thing is reviewed by the propaganda departmentâ€. Daily life in North Korea at times resembles a scripted TV set, Thae said. On a show featuring defectors called the â€Moranbong Clubâ€ Thae said he had watched the program when he was working as a diplomat in London after searching â€North Koreaâ€ in Korean, on YouTube. He said he had recognized another defector panelist on the show, which typically pays its participants for appearances. â€I told my family that I used to do night shifts with this man!â€ Thae said, gesturing toward Han who replied that Thae, who outranked him at Pyongyangâ€™s foreign ministry, had sworn at him at the time for not doing his duty properly. Producers then used visual effects to superimpose North Korean military uniforms on both men. â€Why did you swear at him?â€ the presenter asked. â€I canâ€™t say here! ,â€ said Thae, laughing.

"279","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-prison-corruption-idUSKBN14P2HX?il=0","Ueslei Marcelino and Alonso Soto","Brazilian prosecutors on Thursday demanded a dollar private prison contract in Amazonas state be axed due to signs of corruption as the government blamed mismanagement for the countryâ€™s bloodiest prison massacre in decades. Amazonasâ€™ accounting court prosecutor, Carlos Almeida, said he found signs of payment irregularities in a contract the state signed with the Pamas consortium to manage all its prisons, including the Anisio Jobim penitentiary where 56 inmates died in an uprising this week. The killings have raised questions about whether private companies should be running prisons in Brazil, especially in Amazonas where the inmate population has more than doubled since 2010. The Pamas consortium, made up of Umanizzare GestÃ£o Prisional e ServiÃ§os Ltda and LFG LocaÃ§oes e ServiÃ§os Ltda, received about 400 million reais ($125 million) in 2016 to Amazonasâ€™ prisons, Almeida said. That was after Umanizzare signed a contract with Amazonas in 2015 for the consortium to run state prisons for 27 years at an estimated cost of 205 million reais a year, and received a payment of 198 million reais at the time of signing, said Almeida. The difference between the 2016 payment and the estimated cost of the contract raised prosecutorsâ€™ suspicions, as did the original price tag which was well above similar agreements in other states, Almeida said. â€There are indications those payments could have been inflated,â€ Almeida told Reuters, adding that he had warned state authorities about problems with the contract and recommended they not sign the deal. Umanizzare and LFG did not respond to requests for comment. Brazilian Justice Minister Alexandre Moraes said the private prison management model is not to blame for the massacre, but pointed to mistakes by the administrators of the prison, which had three times as many inmates as its capacity. Moraes said Umanizzare failed to act on intelligence reports indicating that inmates planned a prison break during the holidays and that weapons were easily smuggled into the facility during a New Yearâ€™s eve party. The office of Brazilâ€™s said on Thursday it has launched an investigation into the conditions of the prison systems in Amazonas, Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul and Rondonia. The probe could lead to the federal takeover of those prisons, the office said in a statement. WHO IS TO BLAME? Umanizzare said in a Wednesday statement the state was responsible for the armed surveillance of the inmates, while the company was only responsible for cleaning, medical treatment and electronic surveillance. But Moraes said at a news conference on Thursday that the company was also responsible for security at the prison. The guards hired by the company were poorly trained and could be easily bribed because of their low salaries, according to a ministry report on conditions at the prison in 2016. Amazonas Governor Jose Meloâ€™s press office said that the hiring of the consortium by the state was done through the correct legal means. Melo denied reports that he received campaign funds from Umanizzare in 2014. His press office said that he received 300, 000 reais in donations from another company, Auxilio Agenciamento de Recursos Humanos e Servicos Ltda, which provided prison management services until 2013. Prosecutor Almeida said that Auxilio changed its name to Umanizzare that year, meaning both companies are controlled by the same family group. In a response to further enquiries by Reuters, Meloâ€™s press office said the donations by Auxilio were legal and fully declared to electoral authorities. Private management of prisons is relatively new in Brazil, with less than two dozen penitentiaries under the model. Yet it remains an attractive alternative for heavily indebted state governments as Brazil remains mired in recession. Watchdog groups say this weekâ€™s massacre in Manaus shows profits and prison management cannot mix. â€An inmate is not a commodity and cannot be the object of a contract,â€ said Marcos Fuchs, vice president of the National Council of Criminal and Prison Policies. â€This model is ripe for corruption. .. Brazil should not follow in the steps of the United States.â€ The United States has more private prisons than any other nation, but the model has come under harsh criticism by human rights groups, who say it only gives incentive for more incarcerations to sustain profits. The United States has the worldâ€™s biggest prison population. In Amazonas, the number of inmates rose to 10, 333 in 2016 from 4, 979 in 2010, according to prison authorities, a rise Melo blamed on increased drug trafficking from neighboring Colombia and Peru, the worldâ€™s top two cocaine producers. Seven of Amazonasâ€™ 19 prisons are under private management. (Reporting by Alonso Soto",0

A spokesman for the U. S. Department of Justice declined to comment. The government can still ask the U. S. Supreme Court to take up the case. Seventeen U. S. states also opposed AmExâ€™s rules. At issue were the more than $50 billion of fees that merchants pay annually to process transactions, and which can be passed along to customers through higher prices. The Justice Department said the appeals court wrongly focused on how the companyâ€™s policy affected customers and merchants, rather than merchants alone. It also said it should have been AmExâ€™s burden to show that its policy promoted competition, not the governmentâ€™s burden to show otherwise. Several dozen merchants including Kroger Co ( ) Target Corp ( ) and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc ( ) supported a rehearing by the original panel, or by all of the appeals courtâ€™s active judges. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2011 by agreeing to change their rules. AmEx accounted for 26. 4 percent of U. S. credit and charge card purchase volume in 2013. It was able to resume enforcing its rules after the 2nd Circuit in December 2015 lifted an injunction imposed by the lower court judge. AmEx spokesman Andrew Johnson said the governmentâ€™s claims still lack merit. â€With todayâ€™s decision, consumers can continue to choose how they pay and our card members will not be discriminated against at the point of sale,â€ he said.

Up to 900, 000 people are expected to pack into the U. S. capital for the New York businessmanâ€™s Jan. 20 to his first political office. Some plan to protest Trumpâ€™s more controversial promises, including plans to build a wall along the Mexican border and deport illegal immigrants. Only three of the more than 30 groups seeking to stage rallies either protesting or celebrating Trumpâ€™s election independently of the Trump Presidential Inaugural Committee have received permits to use National Park Service land before, during or after Trumpâ€™s inauguration. The agency said it expected to begin issuing permits for demonstration sites on park land in coming days, an announcement that came a few hours after the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund said it would sue if the permits were not issued by Friday. â€We believe that this is a significant victory for free speech. They are doing this under threat of litigation,â€ Mara the fundâ€™s executive director, said in a telephone interview. The Park Service had maintained it was following a procedure in place since 2008 by turning over control of sites, including along the parade route from the Capitol to the White House, to Trumpâ€™s Presidential Inaugural Committee. Agency spokesman Mike Litterst said the Park Service would regain control of permits for the Ellipse, a grassy area south of the White House, from the inaugural committee on Jan. 21. Litterst said in an email that the agency was working with more than 30 permit applicants and was still receiving requests. The Park Service has been under a court order since 2008 mandating it to guarantee free speech during presidential inaugurations. Three liberal groups, the ANSWER Coalition, the American Constitution Society and the Black is Back Coalition, have been permitted to hold events near the parade route, but only ANSWER was granted one for Inauguration Day, according to the Park Service permits website. WOMENâ€™S MARCH GOES AHEAD Some 3, 000 police officers and 7, 000 National Guard troops from outside the District will be on hand to help provide security at Trumpâ€™s swearing in, Chris Geldart, the District of Columbiaâ€™s homeland security director said in a phone interview. The biggest inauguration protest, the Womenâ€™s March on Washington on Jan. 21, will go on regardless of the dispute over protest sites since it will be held on city streets. At least one protest could come with a cloud of marijuana smoke, as the DCMJ lobbying group, which spearheaded the legalization of the drug in Washington D. C. in 2015, plans to distribute 4, 200 joints near the inaugural site. Smoking marijuana along the parade route would violate the laws of both the District of Columbia which allows it only in private spaces and the federal government, which bans it outright.

S. health secretary, following a report that the fierce Obamacare critic traded in healthcare company stocks while pushing legislation in Congress that could affect those shares. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and others made their comments as congressional Republicans moved ahead with their effort to dismantle President Barack Obamaâ€™s Affordable Care Act, and signaled the vehemence with which Democrats will fight to protect the 2010 law. Price is an orthopedic surgeon and a Republican congressman from Georgia who, if confirmed by the Senate as Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, would be given the task of carrying out Trumpâ€™s promise to gut the law that has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain medical coverage. The Democrats called on the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) which examines misconduct allegations involving House of Representatives members, to investigate Priceâ€™s stock trades. The Wall Street Journal last month reported that Price bought and sold more than $300, 000 in stock in about 40 healthcare, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies over the past four years while sponsoring and advocating legislation that could influence those companiesâ€™ shares. â€Every American should be shocked by this,â€ Schumer told a news conference. â€We donâ€™t know if he broke the law,â€ Schumer said of Price. â€But there are certainly enough serious questions to warrant a serious investigation before any hearing is held on Congressman Price to become secretary of HHS.â€ Democratic Senator Patty Murray said lawmakers want to know what nonpublic information Price may have had when the transactions at issue were made. Phil Blando, a Trump transition spokesman, called Schumerâ€™s demands a â€stuntâ€ to deflect attention from Obamacareâ€™s â€dismal record.â€ Price, asked by Reuters in a Capitol hallway for a reaction to Schumerâ€™s comments, replied, â€Weâ€™re looking forward to a positive and productive confirmation hearing.â€ A 2012 law prohibits members and employees of Congress from using â€any nonpublic informationâ€ stemming from the personâ€™s position or gained while performing their job for personal benefit. PUBLIC CITIZEN ALSO URGES PROBE The nonpartisan watchdog group Public Citizen also asked the ethics office, as well as the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission, to investigate Price and another Republican congressman, Chris Collins of New York, for possible violations of insider trading and laws and rules. Public Citizen said that, while serving in the House, Collins also sat on the board of directors of Australian biotech company Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd ( ) and was its largest shareholder, with a 17 percent stake. It said Price also bought shares in the company. Collins serves as the Trump transition teamâ€™s congressional liaison. Collins spokesman Michael McAdams said in a statement the congressman â€has followed all ethical guidelines related to his personal finances during his time in the House and will continue to do so.â€ House Republicans had moved on Monday to weaken the ethics office but backtracked a day later after criticism from Democrats and Trump. Trump transition spokesman Blando said the ethics questions Schumer raised about Price should be directed to three sitting Democratic senators, Delawareâ€™s Tom Carper, Virginiaâ€™s Mark Warner and Rhode Islandâ€™s Sheldon Whitehouse, â€who own and have traded hundreds of thousands of dollars in pharmaceutical and health insurance company stocks.â€ â€Hypocrisy is apparently alive and well this morning in Washington,â€ Blando said. A Warner spokeswoman said his investments were managed by an independent trustee. A Whitehouse spokesman said the senator does not direct his trading. A Carper spokeswoman said he has submitted thorough financial disclosures and â€always complied with every requirement and regulation.â€ Republicans will control the White House and Congress once Trump takes office on Jan. 20. In a series of Twitter posts on Thursday, Trump blasted the Democrats over Obamacare, taunting Schumer as â€head clown.â€ â€It is time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive & FAR BETTER!â€ Trump wrote. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said he expects the legislative work on repealing and replacing Obamacare to be completed this year. â€What date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know,â€ Ryan added. Ryan indicated that a Republican proposal to strip womenâ€™s healthcare organization Planned Parenthood of federal funding will be included in the Obamacare repeal legislation. Planned Parenthood draws the ire of many Republicans because it provides abortions, as well as cancer screenings and other services. Republicans criticize Obamacare, one of Obamaâ€™s signature accomplishments in his eight years in office, as an excessive government intrusion into the healthcare market and contend it is harming job growth by burdening businesses. Democrats said Obamacare has extended insurance to millions of Americans and curbed abuses by private insurers such as refusing to provide policies to people with medical conditions.

Amazon. com, the giant he runs, is considering a bid for the bankrupt American Apparel, according to a Reuters exclusive, just as Macyâ€™s and other department stores are losing sales and cutting staff. A deal could be a handy way to show a suspicious of Silicon Valley that heâ€™s saving thousands of U. S. jobs. It wouldnâ€™t be the main reason for Amazon to pounce on American Apparel, whose brand proudly refers to how it manufactures all its clothing in a Los Angeles factory employing some 4, 500 people. The business would be a natural fit with Amazonâ€™s fashion offerings that it launched last year and with earlier acquisitions like Shopbop and Zappos. It might, though, have the added benefit of assuaging Donald Trump. The and the tech industry disagree on everything from encryption to free trade to immigration. Trump singled out Amazon during his campaign for having huge antitrust issues and said the company would have â€such problemsâ€ were he to win the White House. Bezos also personally owns the Washington Post, which has been a vocal critic of the incoming U. S. . Now Trump is using Twitter to threaten companies he deems are doing wrong â€” whether itâ€™s Boeing overcharging for Air Force One or the likes of General Motors and Toyota for potentially moving U. S. jobs abroad to save money. Buying American Apparel could help make Bezos a savior of a dying industry. Macyâ€™s and Kohlâ€™s on Wednesday reported November and December sales that were worse than expected, wiping 14 percent and 19 percent off their valuations on Thursday. Macyâ€™s plans to slash more than 10, 000 jobs, or 7 percent of its workforce. Meanwhile, U. S. digital retail sales are expected to reach more than $500 billion by 2020, a third higher than 2016 estimates according to Forrester Research. Amazon already owns 60 percent of the pie. A deal wouldnâ€™t cost much, either: American Apparel currently has an offer from Gildan Activewear for just $66 million. And Amazonâ€™s avowed and proven disinterest in profit means it should have no problem keeping the retailerâ€™s jobs stateside. Brandishing some â€Made in the USAâ€ cred would be a smart bet by Bezos.

Just how gargantuan is $29. 6 trillion? it would take Bill Gates and the next 399 richest U. S. citizens to buy up all the housing stock in the U. S. It is also worth as much as the combined market capitalization of every U. S. public company. New Yorkâ€™s housing market alone, worth $2. 4 trillion, is roughly equivalent to the gross domestic product of France. Zillow gives each of the 110 million homes in the U.

Compared to previous years, 2016 is a banner year for home values, up 5. 7 percent. The total value has not only recovered from the housing market collapse, when the cumulative value dropped $6. 4 trillion between 2006 and 2012. But it has also set a new record. If the recovery has done one thing, it has turned housing from a national story to a local one, Terrazas noted. â€We have some strong markets now, and some that have slowed down, but I donâ€™t think anyone thinks thereâ€™s a bubble again,â€ he said. Zillowâ€™s report says that 60 percent of the markets in the U. S. are still below what should be their maximum housing values.

The â€Texas Privacy Actâ€ has been marked as a top legislative priority for Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a Republican and conservative Christian who guides the legislative agenda in the state Senate. He said the measure protected the privacy and safety of Texans. â€It is the right thing to do,â€ Patrick told a news conference along with its sponsor, Lois Kolkhorst. The event was punctuated by the howls of protesters nearby in the Capitol building chanting: â€Shame, shame, shame.â€ Similar bills have been filed for several other state legislatures this year that socially conservative backers say offer protections against sexual predators. Critics say the laws are designed to infringe on the civil rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. A major industry group, the Texas Association of Business, said a study it helped conduct showed such legislation in Texas could result in economic losses ranging from $964 million to $8. 5 billion for the state. A law enacted by North Carolina in March 2016 to restrict bathroom access for transgender people the first such state measure prompted a federal civil rights lawsuit and has been blamed for hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses and the relocation of major sporting events from the state. Kolkhorst said the Texas bill would prohibit any local government from adopting an ordinance that prevents a business from making its own policy on access to places such as bathrooms and locker rooms. Local governments are also forbidden from considering those policies when awarding a contract, she said. Chuck Smith, chief executive of LGBT rights group Equality Texas, said the legislation appeared to be unenforceable and targeted a marginalized group of people. â€If this legislature is interested in dealing with predatory behavior, then the target of this legislation needs to be sexual predators. Transgender people are not the predators. Transgender people are more likely to be the victims,â€ he said in an interview.

Bitcoin had gained more than 40 percent in two weeks to hit a high of $1, 139. 89 on Wednesday, just shy of its record of $1, 163 on the Bitstamp exchange . But it dived as low as $885. 41 on Thursday as the yuan jumped by over 1 percent in offshore trading and headed for its strongest performance on record. [ ] Chinese exchanges have reported high volumes of trading of the â€cryptocurrencyâ€ over the past year, during which time the yuan has shed almost 7 percent, its worst annual performance since 1994, while bitcoin has surged 125 percent, outperforming all other currencies for a second year in a row. Bitcoin can used for moving money across the globe quickly and anonymously, and operates outside the control of any central authority. That makes it attractive to those wanting to get around capital controls, such as in China, and also to investors who are worried about a devaluation in their currency. â€Given that the yuanâ€™s weakness over recent months seemed to correlate with bitcoinâ€™s strength more than any other currency, itâ€™s no surprise that bitcoin traders have reacted the way they have to the yuanâ€™s sudden strength today,â€ said Paul Gordon, of Quantave, a firm seeking to make it easier for investors to access digital currency exchanges. Exchanges in China say they account for more than 90 percent of global bitcoin trading, which would help explain why a shift in Chinese demand would sharply affect the price. But many bitcoin experts say Chinese exchanges overstate their volumes in the digital currency, and attribute sharp moves to speculation by, for example, U. S. hedge funds. Some said bitcoinâ€™s fall was a natural reaction to the speed of its previous rise. It is still up more than 50 percent on three months ago, when it was trading at around $600, â€If something goes up very rapidly. ..people make a lot of money, and at some point theyâ€™re going to want to sell, in order to realize their gains,â€ said Marco Streng, CEO of bitcoin mining and trading firm Genesis Mining.

After several failed ceasefire attempts brokered by Kerry and Lavrov, the United States remained out of the latest Syrian talks. It is unclear whether the United States will attend the Astana talks. Russia and Iran both back Assad, but Turkey, a NATO member, has long made clear it would prefer that Assad step down. Ankara, however, has moderated its rhetoric on Assad in recent months and Lavrov said all three countries agreed the priority was to fight terrorism rather than to remove the Syrian leader.

Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Corp on Thursday, accusing the manufacturer of failing to take reasonable steps to protect its routers and security cameras from hackers. The FTC brought the charges as part of a broader effort to improve security of devices, including routers, webcams, digital video recorders and other widely used consumer electronics devices. The company said in a statement it would â€vigorously defend itself against the unwarranted and baseless chargesâ€. The FTC â€fails to allege, as it must, that actual consumers suffered or are likely to suffer actual substantial injuries,â€ it added. Concerns about security of devices, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the internet of things, or IoT, have surged since last year when hackers used armies of compromised routers, webcams and other electronic devices to launch a series of increasingly powerful attacks that severed access to some of the worldâ€™s biggest websites. Security experts blamed those attacks on lax security in large numbers of IoT devices from dozens of manufacturers. They have called on the industry to better secure their equipment, removing vulnerabilities such as the use of default passwords that give hackers the keys to remotely access machines over the web. Allison Nixon, director of security research with cyber intelligence firm Flashpoint, said the FTCâ€™s action could encourage IoT manufacturers to beef up security. â€I think vendors are going to take it seriously,â€ she said. â€The IoT world needs to shape up quickly because this is a big problem.â€ The FTCâ€™s complaint alleged that neglected to protect the devices from â€widely known and reasonably foreseeable risks of unauthorized access,â€ even as it highlighted security features in communications with consumers.

Portugalâ€™s central bank said earlier it plans to hold further talks with Lone Star after selecting it ahead of other prospective purchasers including Chinaâ€™s Minsheng Financial Holding and U.

Portugal had hoped to decide on the sale of Novo Banco by the end of last year, ahead of a final August 2017 deadline for the sale. â€We will continue to work tirelessly with the Bank of Portugal. .. and the Portuguese Government to confirm a final agreement to support Novo Banco for the benefit of its customers, employees, creditors, and the overall Portuguese economy,â€ Lone Star Europe president Oliver Brahin said in a statement. The central bank said that Lone Starâ€™s proposal â€is the one that goes the furthest,â€ in ensuring stability of the financial system and confidence in Novo Banco. But the central bank added that Lone Star set conditions in its offer that could have an impact on public accounts, which it will seek to â€minimise or remove in the deeper negotiations that start now.â€ The finance ministry welcomed the next stage of the negotiations aiming to overcome those conditions. â€The government always underlined that this sales process to private investors must ensure that there is no impact on public finances or cost to taxpayers,â€ it said in a statement. Lone Star made no mention of conditions on its offer, but it was â€deeply optimistic about Portugalâ€ and its economic future, Brahin said.

Portugal salvaged Novo Banco, or the â€good bankâ€ in a 4. rescue of BES in 2014, which collapsed under the weight of debts of its founding family. An attempt to sell Novo Banco in 2015 failed because the bids were considered too low. The Portuguese authorities have not said how much they are seeking for Novo Banco. The government itself put up 3. 9 billion euros ($4. 1 billion) for the rescue of BES but analysts doubt it will recover anything near that figure in the sale. The rescue has led to a series of court cases by shareholders and other stakeholders hit by the process, prompting bidders to fear future litigation.

Esteban Santiago, a Iraq war veteran, had a history of acting erratically and investigators are probing whether mental illness played a role in the latest U. S. mass shooting. According to court papers, he told agents he planned the attack and bought a ticket to Florida. Santiago was charged on Saturday in federal court and could potentially face the death penalty if convicted in the case, U. S. prosecutors said. Marlin Ritzman, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigationâ€™s office in Anchorage, told a news conference Santiago walked into the office in November and said his mind was being controlled by a U. S. intelligence agency. He was turned over to local police, who took him to a medical facility for a mental evaluation. â€Santiago was having terroristic thoughts and believed he was being influenced by ISIS (the Islamic State militant group,)â€ Anchorage Police Chief Chris Tolley told the news conference. A handgun police took from Santiago during the evaluation was returned to him early last month, Tolley told reporters. The police chief said it was not clear if it was the same weapon used on Friday. Officials in Anchorage said the gun was returned because Santiago had not been adjudicated to be mentally ill. â€As far as I know, this is not somebody that would have been prohibited (from having a gun) based on the information they had,â€ U. S. Attorney Karen Loeffler told the news conference. Investigators said they have not ruled out terrorism as a motive and that the suspectâ€™s recent travel is being reviewed. Federal prosecutors charged Santiago with carrying out violence at an airport, causing serious bodily injury, using a firearm during a crime of violence and causing death to a person through the use of a firearm, the U. S. Department of Justice said in a statement. He will appear in court in Fort Lauderdale on Monday. Five people were killed and six wounded in the rampage, while about three dozen were taken to local hospitals with bruises or broken bones suffered in the chaos as passengers fled the crowded baggage claim area. â€™METHODICALâ€™ SHOOTING Authorities say Santiago arrived in Ft. Lauderdale on a connecting flight from Alaska and retrieved a Walther 9mm handgun from his checked luggage before loading it in a bathroom and shooting indiscriminately. According to the criminal complaint, Santiago fired the weapon 10 to 15 times, aiming it at his victimsâ€™ heads. â€He was described as walking while shooting in a methodical manner,â€ the complaint said. Witnesses said the gunman, who was wearing a blue â€Star Warsâ€ said nothing as he fired and surrendered to police only after running out of ammunition. The Broward County sheriff has said it took the first deputy about 70 to 80 seconds to contact the suspect after the first shots rang out and that when the deputy confronted him, he dropped the gun and was taken into custody. Authorities said three of the six victims who suffered gunshot wounds are in intensive care. The others are in good condition. Those killed included a volunteer firefighter in his sixties and a retiree on holiday with her husband. Santiago served from 2007 to 2016 in the Puerto Rico National Guard and Alaska National Guard, including a deployment to Iraq from 2010 to 2011, according to the Pentagon. A private first class and combat engineer, he received half a dozen medals before being transferred to the inactive ready reserve in August last year. An aunt said Santiago returned from his deployment â€a different person,â€ MSNBC reported. Santiagoâ€™s brother Bryan, who lives in Puerto Rico, told CNN he believed authorities did not do enough to help his mentally ill sibling. â€They had him hospitalized for four days, and then they let him go. How are you going to let someone leave a psychological center after four days when he is saying that he is hearing voices?â€ Bryan Santiago told CNN. The attack was the latest in a series of U. S. mass shootings, some inspired by Islamist militants, others carried out by loners or the mentally disturbed. Last June, Florida was the scene of the deadliest shooting rampage in modern U. S. history, when a gunman apparently inspired by Islamic State killed 49 people and wounded 53 at the gay nightclub â€Pulseâ€ in Orlando.

"292","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-florida-shooting-security-idUSKBN14Q2H7","Joseph Ax","The deadly shooting at a Florida airport on Friday is likely to rekindle an ongoing debate over whether screening systems should be even more exacting. But experts say preventing attacks like the one on Friday, when a gunman opened fire in a baggage claim area at Fort International Airport, is almost impossible given the large public areas at U. S. airports, despite the billions of dollars spent on security. â€To the extent it was not in a secure area, it doesnâ€™t really identify any issues around airport security,â€ said Robert Mann, an aviation consultant. â€A guy walks into a bar, a guy walks into an airport baggage claim room â€” neither of them are secure.â€ Fridayâ€™s attack killed five people and injured at least eight, authorities said. Security at most major airports worldwide is generally focused on protecting aircraft from potential attackers and deadly devices, rather than the airports themselves. As a result, much of the space at terminals is easily accessible to the public, with no formal screening before passengers go through checkpoints to get to their departure gates. The debate over whether to extend security screening to public areas intensified following the bombings inside a terminal at Brussels Airport in March 2016, which killed 32 people and injured hundreds. Some critics have cited as a model Israelâ€™s Ben Gurion Airport, where private security companies trained by the national security agency Shin Bet and backed by police officers profile passengers, question individual travelers and use bomb detectors at the airportâ€™s entrance. But experts say that approach has drawbacks, possibly just shifting the target to another part of the airport. â€It is logistically impractical to try to protect these areas, unfortunately, and the reason is no matter how far you move the boundary out, you will always have some sort of soft target area,â€ Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, said. The cost of implementing that type of screening would also be prohibitive, given the number of major U. S. airports. In response to the Florida shooting, law enforcement agencies at several U. S. airports said they beefed up security presence, including in Chicago and New York. Fridayâ€™s shooting, in which the gunman apparently retrieved a checked gun from his luggage, loaded it in a bathroom and then opened fire, could prompt debate about whether travelers should be permitted to stow guns in checked bags, Harteveldt said. Addressing one potential danger often simply creates an opportunity for another type of threat, Mann said. â€Itâ€™s essentially â€ Mann said. â€Thatâ€™s what security has always been.â€ (Reporting by Joseph Ax",0

S. intelligence agencies said in an assessment. Russiaâ€™s objectives were to undermine public faith in the U. S. democratic process, denigrate former Secretary of State Clinton, make it harder for her to win and harm her presidency if she did, an unclassified report released on Friday by the top U. S. intelligence agency said. â€We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U. S. presidential election,â€ the report said. â€We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments.â€ Russian authorities, which have previously denied interfering in the U. S. elections, offered no immediate comment on the report on Saturday, and the reaction of the countryâ€™s media was . The report, although it omitted classified details, was the U. S. governmentâ€™s starkest public description of what it says was an unprecedented Russian campaign to manipulate the American body politic. Reports of Russian interference in the already divisive election have roiled Washington, even as the U. S. Congress on Friday certified Trumpâ€™s victory in the Electoral College. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million ballots. The reportâ€™s conclusions, though lacking details of how the Russians may have relayed the material to WikiLeaks and others, will give ammunition to Democrats and Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans in Congress who want tougher action against Russia, setting the scene for a potential showdown with Trump. It could also give a boost to members of Congress seeking an independent, bipartisan investigation of Russian hacking. Trump, who has developed a rocky relationship with U. S. spy agencies and at times disparaged their work, defended the legitimacy of his election victory after receiving a nearly briefing Friday on the report. The report neither assessed â€the impact Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 electionâ€ nor did it provide details on the evidence underpinning its conclusions, a fact likely to keep alive the controversy over what Moscow may have done. In Moscow, state TV Channel One briefly covered the report, focusing on Trumpâ€™s comments that the interference had no impact on the outcome of the election. The broadcaster, which led its news program on Orthodox Christmas celebrations and unusually low temperatures in the Russian capital, also said the arguments used in the U. S. report had been widely mocked by Internet users. RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AGENCY The report said U. S. intelligence agencies believe Russian military intelligence, the GRU, used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks. com and the Guccifer 2. 0 â€personaâ€ to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and top Democrats as part of the effort. The release of the emails led to embarrassing media coverage for Clinton and triggered the resignation of the DNCâ€™s chief. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said he did not receive emails stolen from the DNC and top Clinton aide John Podesta from â€a state party.â€ However, Assange did not rule out the possibility that he got the material from a third party. Russian actors were not found to have targeted U. S. systems that are involved in tallying votes, the report said. The report was produced by the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Agency. Also on Friday, the U. S. Department of Homeland Security designated U. S. election infrastructure as critical infrastructure, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. While the report found Russia had conducted cyber attacks on both the Democratic and the Republican parties, it made clear that the primary aims were to harm Clinton whether or not she won the election and evolved over time. â€When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency,â€ it said. â€We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help Trumpâ€™s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him,â€ it said. The CIA and FBI had high confidence in this judgment and NSA moderate confidence, the report said. Neither the Russian Embassy in Washington, nor Clinton aides immediately responded to requests for comment. The report suggested Putin was motivated in part by personal animus toward Clinton. â€Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him,â€ it said. â€™TROUBLING CHAPTER IN ONGOING STORYâ€™ In a statement after his intelligence briefing, Trump did not squarely address whether he was told of the agenciesâ€™ belief Russia carried out the hacking. Instead, he said: â€Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizationsâ€ including the DNC. â€There was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines,â€ Trump said. The businessman, who is to be inaugurated as president on Jan. 20, also said he would appoint a team to give him a plan within 90 days of taking office on how to prevent cyber attacks but suggested that he would keep their recommendations secret. The report did not reveal how the intelligence agencies collected the evidence underpinning their conclusions or the evidence itself, including the means by which Russian military intelligence â€relayedâ€ the materials filched from the DNC and other hacking targets to WikiLeaks and others, omissions likely to leave the report open to criticism. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence who was briefed on the report on Friday, took issue with Trumpâ€™s comments. â€The â€™s statement that the Russian hacking had â€™absolutely no effect on the outcome of the electionâ€™ is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense,â€ Schiff said. â€It is one thing to say that there was no tampering with vote tallying which is true it is another thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to . .. Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyber operations had no effect on the campaigns,â€ he said. â€The consequence of these disclosures was hugely beneficial to the and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended.â€ Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said his panel would continue to compile â€facts surrounding Russiaâ€™s active measures,â€ adding: â€This is a troubling chapter in an ongoing story.â€ (Reporting by Steve Holland, Mark Hosenball, Yara Bayoumy and Warren Strobel and Jonathan Landay in Washington",0

Donald Trump said on Friday Mexico would repay the United States for his planned border wall, a day after news emerged that his transition team was exploring getting the Congress to vote to approve the funding. Trump told the New York Times he would most likely seek repayment through renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which groups the United States, Mexico and Canada. Sean Spicer, a spokesman for Trump, said on Friday the incoming administration would need government funding to build the wall and that Trump said in October Mexicoâ€™s payment would be a reimbursement. â€The idea that weâ€™re going through the appropriations process and figuring out how to pay for it shouldnâ€™t be news,â€ he told a briefing, confirming earlier reports on the funding. Trumpâ€™s promise to build a wall on the U. S. border, and make Mexico pay for it, was a major campaign theme and helped energize his supporters. The suggestion has infuriated Mexican officials who have said they would never agree to pay for a wall. Trump may face resistance in Congress to the idea of the United States paying for the wall. Some Republican lawmakers worry about the high cost and question whether it is the best way to solve the complex issue of illegal migration. Some conservative groups have called for a crackdown on benefits and jobs available to illegal migrants, which they say are a magnet for migration. Republican Representative Luke Messer told reporters on Friday he had proposed legislation to get Mexico to pay for the border wall by ending a child tax credit given to illegal immigrant parents, which he said cost $4. 2 billion annually. â€If you close that loophole for two years, you could pay for the higher ticket cost,â€ Messer said, referring to one estimate that a wall could cost $10 billion. CNN and other media organizations reported on Friday Trumpâ€™s transition team had signaled to congressional Republicans that he preferred to fund the wall through Congress as soon as April. In response, Trump tweeted that the media was not reporting that Mexico would repay money spent to build the wall. A â€™Pay for the Wallâ€™ memo Trumpâ€™s team issued in early 2016 proposed pressuring Mexico by cutting off remittances from undocumented Mexicans in the United States. It proposed amending the Patriot Act, passed after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, to include wire transfers as accounts that could be frozen. â€Itâ€™s an easy decision for Mexico: make a payment of $ billion to ensure that $24 billion (in remittances) continues to flow into their country year after year,â€ the memo said. â€We have the leverage, so Mexico will back down,â€ it said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietoâ€™s office declined to comment on Trumpâ€™s comments on Friday. In August, Pena Nieto told Trump Mexico would not pay for a border wall. Representative Martha McSally, the Republican chair of the border and maritime security subcommittee, told Reuters a 2006 law known as the â€Secure Fence Actâ€ would give Trump the authority he needs to extend fencing or build a wall. An internal report prepared by U. S. Customs and Border Protection estimates initial costs for expanding border fencing would cost over $11. 3 billion. Building a wall would be more costly. Trump has signaled since being elected that he would be open to fencing rather than a wall in some areas. If funding was tied to a government funding bill, lawmakers could be forced to approve it to avoid a government shutdown. House appropriators have no interest in threatening a shutdown, spokeswoman Jennifer Hing said. â€The (appropriations) committee has not received any request from the Trump team or GOP leadership on this issue. If and when a proposal is received, we will take a careful look at it,â€ she said. The Mexican peso which briefly weakened about 0. 2 percent against the dollar following Trumpâ€™s tweet, fell to record lows this week as Trump intensified criticism of businesses making goods in Mexico rather than in the United States.

S. election infrastructure as critical, widening the options the government has to protect voting machines from cyber attacks. The decision, announced in a statement by DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, followed a 2016 presidential campaign marred by concerns that hackers could disrupt the election. Also on Friday, U. S. intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of directing a campaign to hack Democratic Party computers in an effort to help Republican Donald Trump win the U. S. presidency. U. S. officials determined hackers targeted more than 20 statesâ€™ voter registration systems during the election but that there was no evidence tallies were altered when ballots were cast on Nov. 8. Elevating election systems to critical infrastructure puts it on par with other sectors eligible to receive prioritized cyber security assistance from DHS, including communication and transportation systems, the banking industry and the energy grid. Election infrastructure includes polling places, centralized vote tabulations locations, storage facilities and voter registration databases and voting machines, Johnson said. Johnson said he and his staff had consulted with state and local election officials and that he was â€aware that many of them are opposed to this designation.â€ Some conservative states such as Georgia objected when the idea was floated during the presidential campaign, claiming elections have historically been overseen by local officials. The classification was not â€a federal takeover, regulation, oversight or intrusion concerning elections in this country,â€ Johnson said in a statement. â€This designation does nothing to change the role state and local governments have in administering and running elections.â€ (Reporting by Eric Beech and Dustin Volz",0
"297","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ces-android-alexa-idUSKBN14R005?il=0","Julia Love","Companies ranging from appliance maker Whirlpool Corp to Ford Motor Co unveiled products featuring Alexa, the digital assistant from Amazon that responds to voice commands. Most strikingly, Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co [HWT. UL] which manufactures smartphones running on the Android operating system produced by Alphabet Incâ€™s Google, announced that its flagship handset will come with an app that gives users access to Alexa in the United States. The adoption of Alexa by a prominent Android manufacturer indicates that Amazon may have opened up an early lead over Google as the companies race to present their digital assistants to as many people as possible, analysts said. Many in the technology industry believe that such digital assistants will supplant keyboards and touch screens as a primary way consumers interact with devices. While the shift is only in the early stages, Google must establish a strong presence quickly, particularly on Android devices, to maintain its dominance in internet search, said analyst Jan Dawson of Jackdaw Research. â€œTo the extent that voice becomes more important and something other than Googleâ€™s voice assistant becomes the most popular voice interface on Android phones, thatâ€™s a huge loss for Google in terms of data gathering, training its AI (artificial intelligence) and ultimately the ability to drive advertising revenue,â€ he said. Alexa debuted on the Amazon Echo smart speaker, and Amazon is establishing a broad array of hardware and software partnerships around it. The competing Google Assistant launched last year on the companyâ€™s Pixel smartphone, after appearing on Googleâ€™s messaging app, and has begun to roll out to devices as well. Graphics processor maker Nvidia Corp announced at CES that its Shield television will feature the assistant. While Google has expressed an interest in bringing its assistant to other Android smartphones, the decision to debut the feature on its own hardware may have strained relations with manufacturers, Dawson said. â€œIt highlights just what a strategic mistake it can be for services companies to make their own hardware and give it preferential access to new services,â€ he said. A spokeswoman for Google declined to comment. While Amazon has a head start, Google is no by no means out of the race, given the strength of its internet search technology. The Google Assistant can already field queries that Alexa cannot, said Sergei Burkov, chief executive of Alterra. ai, an artificial intelligence company. â€œA huge part of an assistant is search,â€ he said. â€œGoogle is a search company.

"298","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-brazil-prison-idUSKBN14Q1FR?il=0","Pedro Fonseca and Brad Brooks","Jailed members of Brazilâ€™s most powerful drug gang killed 31 inmates at a penitentiary on Friday, decapitating and cutting out the hearts of most of them, in revenge for a separate prison massacre that left 56 dead this week. The bloodletting in the Monte Cristo prison in the Amazonian state of Roraima, carried out by members of the First Capital Command (PCC) gang, sparked fears that months of violence between criminal groups controlling Brazilâ€™s prisons had spiraled out of control. The PCC itself was targeted on Sunday in neighboring Amazonas state in Brazilâ€™s worst prison slaughter in more than two decades. In a cellphone video that circulated widely on social media, PCC members are seen hacking away at bodies littering an outdoor patio inside the prison. â€You killed our brothers, didnâ€™t you? Look here, look what is going to happen you! This is revenge for what you did to our brothers,â€ a PCC member is heard saying on the video as dozens of bodies lie in thick pools of blood. One victim, and wearing surfer shorts, began to move on the ground. The inmate taking the video calls out to fellow gang members â€Weâ€™ve got a live one!â€ before another gang member rushes over and cuts off the victimâ€™s head with a barbecue knife. State officials said the riot in Roraimaâ€™s largest prison was brought under control by elite police forces. Earlier, authorities put the death toll at 33 but by Friday evening lowered that figure to 31 dead. Violence between rival drug gangs at the same jail had already led to 10 deaths in October. Roraimaâ€™s top security official Uziel de Castro blamed Fridayâ€™s violence at the prison on the PCC. He later added that it was believed most of the inmates killed Friday were not members of the group responsible for this weekâ€™s attack on the PCC in Amazonas and indeed had no gang affiliations. Justice Minister Alexandre Moraes insisted that the government had control over Brazilâ€™s prison system the fourth largest in world and home to more than 620, 000 inmates. Security experts had predicted more violence in Brazilâ€™s penitentiaries in the wake of Mondayâ€™s massacre. â€Itâ€™s getting really ugly. This situation is clearly snowballing and there is nothing the government can do to stop the violence in the short term,â€ said Rafael Alcadipani, a public security expert at the Getulio Vargas Foundation think tank in Sao Paulo. â€We are paying the price for 50 years of total neglect of the penitentiary system.â€ UNEASY ALLIANCE In Mondayâ€™s uprising, PCC members were attacked by the North Family drug faction, which controls the Anisio Jobim penitentiary in Amazonas, according to officials. North Family is believed to dominate cocaine traffic in Amazonas from Colombia and Peru, according to authorities. The group is allied with the Rio de Red Command drug gang, Brazilâ€™s second most powerful faction after PCC. For more than two decades, PCC and Red Command maintained an uneasy alliance, ensuring that a steady flow of drugs and guns flowed across Brazilâ€™s long jungle border. But about six months ago PCC and Red Command split, as PCC moved to take control of lucrative drug routes across the border with Paraguay and become Brazilâ€™s dominant gang. Experts say PCC also has been moving to infiltrate areas in Red Commandâ€™s home base of Rio de Janeiro, further stoking a turf war that threatens to spill onto the streets of Brazilâ€™s biggest cities. Since the split, Red Command has allied itself with smaller regional gangs to confront PCC, primarily in the north and northeast of Brazil, where prison violence boiled over this week. Alcadipani, the public security expert, said Brazilâ€™s penitentiary system has been â€ â€ by the gangs and that mass killings were rare until recent months because of a truce between the countryâ€™s biggest criminal factions. â€But we see that as soon as we have a gang war, these killings are inevitably going to happen because the state has no control over the prisons,â€ said Alcadipani.

"299","https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/09/trump-presidents-carter-bush-clinton-238125","AIDAN QUIGLEY","During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people. The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights. In Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors. “The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.” As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear. Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it. At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former acting Attorney General General Sally Yates appear before the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism for a hearing on Russian interference in the 2016 election on May 8, 2017. John Shinkle/POLITICO And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature. George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.” As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said. Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues. Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.” George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary. Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor. “We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.” Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president. “There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.” By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time. While in office, former presidents occasionally turn to their predecessors for guidance. Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource. “Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said. For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified. Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake. “What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.”All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April. But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was “encouraged” by their first post-election meeting. Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS’ John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama. “He was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,” Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was “inappropriate.” Former President Barack Obama speaks at a community event on the Presidential Center at the South Shore Cultural Center, Wednesday, May 3, 2017, in Chicago.

As president, Trump called Obama a “bad (or sick) guy!” as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush “not nice” during the campaign, said the Bush administration “lied” about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton “the WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.”George H.W. Bush and Carter weren’t excluded from Trump’s slights. “Enough is Enough- No More Bushses!” Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage. Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration. And Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and — while revealing that he voted for Sanders — Carter said the ""downturn"" of human rights ""preceded 2016."" “President Carter, I think he hopes that he won’t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,” Hochman said. “Actually, I’m sure he would.”American Civil Liberties Union attorney Omar Jadwat speaks Monday after a hearing before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va.

MCCASKILL Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He’s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump. “They may have personal opinions, but they’re not going to express them,” Skinner said. “Both 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they’ve been both very cautious about what they say.” McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. “I wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,” he said. Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today’s events in Washington. “I think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,” he said.",1

As with several other aspects of his presidential campaign process, the lead-up to the ceremony has been filled with embarrassing gaffes and miscommunication.  It is currently unclear as to whether Trump will succeed in securing any high profile singers to perform on the day. So far the very short list of confirmed acts is comprised of America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho, The Rockettes (the announcement of which has prompted considerable controversy), and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. What we do know for sure is that there is a fairly big (and still growing) list of major artists who definitely won't be performing on the day. Here is who has declined so far: This rumour was started by Anthony Scaramucci of the Trump transition team, who claimed that Trump would be ""the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay-rights stance. Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for the inauguration."" The Rockettes are being 'forced' to perform at Trump's inauguration That sounded pretty definite. Unfortunately John's publicist Fran Curtis came straight back with a statement to the New York Times: ""Incorrect. He will NOT be performing."" John added his own thoughts in an interview with the Guardian, where he said: ""I don't really want my music to be involved in anything to do with an American election campaign. ""I'm British. I've met Donald Trump, he was very nice to me, it's nothing personal, his political views are his own, mine are very different, I'm not a Republican in a million years. Why not ask Ted f***ing Nugent? Or one of those f***ing country stars? They'll do it for you."" In early December it looked very likely that Bocelli would duet with America's Got Talent runner-up Jackie Evancho. Due to a serious backlash from his fans, however, Bocelli has reportedly pulled out of any potential performance. Ice T An odd one considering everything that Donald Trump's campaign said about Black Lives Matter and hip hop - more so when you consider the fact that Ice T penned a song called 'Cop Killer' which was written as a protest against police brutality. But Ice T claims that the team did reach out to him, or at least joked about what would happen if they did. He wrote on Twitter: ""I just got [called] to perform at the inauguration. I didn't pick up and blocked the number."" Dion is scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration ceremony (20 January) and is unlikely to cancel due to fierce loyalty to her fans. ""We tend to be more liberal-minded. When we see somebody that's preaching division and hate and bigotry, it's unlikely that he'll get a lot of creative people that want to be associated with him."" mAdam Lambert was fairly diplomatic when asked about whether he would perform at the inauguration for Trump, considering his active campaigning for LGBTQ rights and the appalling record Trump's current campaign team has on the same issues. ""I don't think I would take money on that one,"" he told the BBC. ""I don't think I'd be endorsing that. They might struggle.""Speaking to The Wrap, Dixie Chicks manager Simon Renshaw not only denied that the band would perform, but also gave an answer on the wider industry's reluctance to participate. ""No one is prepared to normalise what is going on in the country right now,"" he said. ""If anyone does do it, I hope that the cheque they get is in the nine figures. Because it's probably the last cheque they're ever going to get.""",1

Michigan DNR Marine Biologist Dr. Debra Polowotski arrived at Good Harbor Bay and confirmed the 21 foot-long giant squid to be a very rare fresh-water species of genus Architeuthis. “We thought they were already in Lake Erie, we had no idea they were in Lake Michigan. This is first time there’s been an actual specimen recovered, so this is very exciting”, she said. It is believed that a few of the squid escaped from the Cleveland Sea World complex during the great Northeast blackout of 2003 when they were very young, and somehow made it into Lake Erie. According to Dr. Polowotski, the squid were kept contained in Lake Erie, as the Detroit River is too narrow and shallow for the squid to swim upstream. “They are intimidated by closed-in spaces. They need a lot of room. You have to remember that this is a very big animal”, she said. Dr. Polotwotski also confirmed that the squid is a female and further examination of the corpse indicated that it had recently laid eggs. “Hopefully the walleye can keep the tiny-giant squid population under control, else there is some cause for concern”, said Dr. Polowotski. “Boaters and swimmers really need to exercise some caution”. The animal was discovered by Bob Ritchie and his sister Jill, both of Romeo. “We were just, you know, taking an evening walk along the beach, heading out to the sandbar when we stumbled across it”, said Bob. “We were singing, drinking whiskey out of the bottle, not thinking about tomorrow.

"306","https://www.newsweek.com/president-donald-trump-kim-jong-un-nobel-peace-prize-north-korea-south-korea-905146","MARIA PEREZ","With the unthinkable now cautiously possible, peace between North and South Korea, speculation about President Donald Trump becoming a Nobel Peace Prize winner has begun. If peace in the Korean Peninsula truly happens, the Nobel committee could be left with a difficult choice regarding Trump’s candidacy. Recognizing those who helped bring peace to the region would seem like an easy choice, but a decision to give Trump the award could force the Nobel Prize committee into a fierce political debate on whether a man who has openly mocked foreign leaders, launched multiple airstrikes and has threatened war, deserves an award for peace. But, if the reconciliation happens, how could Trump’s apparent achievement not be recognized? Donald Trump Jr. said regardless of what unfolds, his father won’t get the credit. “Remember who decides this stuff,” he tweeted. “... The globalist elite would never give him that win.” President Donald Trump listens during a joint news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the East Room of the White House April 27, 2018 in Washington, DC. Many are saying Trump is the reason behind the peace summit where North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in shook hands and signed the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula, formally ending the Korean war. It’s not just Trump. He and Kim Jong Un could both claim the award this year, Trump aides and an oddsmaker from Britain said, according to New York Magazine.Trump has taken a hard foreign policy stance with North Korea since he took office. With “rocket man” quips and threatening words of military strength, peace with the North Korea Leader appeared a lost cause. But fast forward to April 2018, and Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in are shaking hands at the Military Demarcation Line, signing the Panmunjom Declaration for Peace, Prosperity and Unification on the Korean Peninsula and formally ending the Korean war. After the apparently successful meeting between the Korean leaders Trump is now scheduled to meet with the North Korean leader soon, with a location yet to be determined. “I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks, we look forward to that,"" Trump said during a Friday press conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. ""We're down to two countries as to a site, and we'll let you know what that site is."" If that meeting and Friday’s summit leads to a peace accord, GOP leaders are saying a Nobel Prize would be warranted. Senator Lindsey Graham and former Trump administration official Carl Higbie have already voiced their support for him to win the award. “We’re not there yet, but if this happens, President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,” Graham said on Friday on Fox & Friends. Laura Ingraham tweeted her support for him to win the award on Friday. “When will we see the headline: “Trump Ends the Korean War”? Unlike Obama, he actually deserves the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Ingraham said. If Trump were to win the Nobel Peace Prize, he would not be the first controversial winner. Le Duc Tho became the first and only person to voluntarily refuse a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating a ceasefire on Vietnam with U.S. Secretary of the State Henry Kissinger. Despite Kissinger’s acceptance of the award, Tho refused to accept because “peace has not been really restored in South Vietnam.” “When the Paris agreement on Vietnam is respected, guns are silenced, and peace is really restored in South Vietnam, I will consider the acceptance of this prize,” he said. Other controversial candidates who have won the award include German journalist Carl Von Ossietzky, who was awarded the prize in 1935 after publishing secret details about the German remilitarization in breach of the Treaty of Versailles before World War II began. The Nazi Party put pressure on the Norwegian Nobel Committee to not grant the award to Ossietzky in 1934, but the committee eventually gave him the award the following year. His win caused two members of the committee to quit, saying they did not want to get involved with what was going on in Germany at the time. Former President Barack Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, was another controversial win. The Obama administration said it was embarrassing to win the prestigious award his first year in office. The committee said Obama won because of “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples."" The first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, Wangari Maathai, also had controversy surrounding her selection. Maathai was granted the award for her efforts to empower women living in rural areas in Kenya to reverse deforestation. Her win, however, was slammed by many because of remarks she allegedly made in a Kenyan newspaper, saying that HIV/AIDS were created by Western scientists to try to",1

This announcement comes after speculation and rumors that one of the indictments handed down by Robert Mueller’s grand jury were for her. With recent news breaking that Clinton paid a Russian agency for information on Donald Trump, it is unsurprising that Mueller would target Clinton, nor is it really shocking that she would high-tail it out of the country just in case she is one of the people he is coming after on Monday.

Barr appeared before the House and told them that it was time to investigate the investigators, which could lead to criminal charges. Here is more from Fox News: Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett said Tuesday on “Hannity” that Attorney General William Barr’s review of the Trump-Russia collusion investigation will lead to a criminal investigation. “A headline today is that William Barr’s personally reviewing the conduct of the FBI in launching the Trump Russia collusion hoax. He knows and there is a plethora of evidence that the process by the FBI was corrupted by political bias and personal animus,” Jarrett told Sean Hannity. According to an administration official who briefed Fox News, Barr has assembled a “team” to investigate the origins of the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. Republicans have called for an investigation of the FBI’s intelligence practices and the basis of the since-discredited Russian collusion narrative following the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe — and they now appear to have assurances that a comprehensive review was underway. The Hill Rep. Robert Aderholt: ""Are you investigating who leaked the existence of the FISA order against Carter Page?"" AG Barr: ""I haven't seen the referrals yet from Congressman Nunes, but obviously if there is a predicate for an investigation, it will be conducted. Jarrett laid out a case for a criminal investigation by Barr. “There was never any credible evidence to launch the investigation and Lisa Page verified that in her own testimony, Comey grudgingly admitted it. And then they made matters worse, they lie to FISA judges to obtain a wiretap warrant. So all of this I think William Barr is going to investigate,” Jarrett said. “And when he receives, sometime this week from members of Congress, a criminal referral he will read what they are laying out the facts, the evidence, and the law which will initiate, I believe, a criminal investigation by Barr.”",1

Doctor James Shephard, who treated Father O’Connor, says he was shocked when he saw the x-ray pictures. “Being a Catholic myself, I found it very disturbing to see such a sacred object in a cleric’s rectum. I found it very shocking that someone could love Jesus that way.” After an extremely delicate 8 hour surgery, doctors were finally able to manually extract the crucifix. “It took many hours and a lot of efforts to get it out of there. We had to make a few incisions to make his anus big enough to get it out. Honestly, I am still trying to figure out how he got it in.”Dr Shephard says this particular Rectal Foreign Body Removal (RFBR) surgery was one of the most complex intervention he’s performed in his career. According to Doctor Shephard, the crucifix’s shape made its extraction particularly complicated. Father Wendel O’Connor refused to answer any questions, saying only that he had “an accident in the shower” and the “there was nothing sexual” in his situation. The priest’s case comes with a particular context which has drawn a lot of media attention to it, but it’s actually common for people to get object stuck in their rear ends. Every year, an average of 5 687 Americans show up at the hospital with various objects stuck in their anal cavities. Some of these cases have drawn a lot of media attention over recent years. In October 2016, a mother of one from Wallasey in England, was rushed to the hospital to have a large vibrator taken out of her rectum.In 2015, a 27-year-old unemployed American man went to the hospital with lower abdominal discomfort following an injection of a liquid adhesive in his anal cavity, five hours earlier.Other objects reportedly found in people’s anal cavities include light bulbs, bottles, cell phones, various animals and even a Buzz Lightyear figurine.",1

According to investigators, the clues that brought their attention to Mr. Clifton were some packagings for a rare medical treatment designed for men born with micropenises, that were visible in the background of a few videos. DPD spokesman, Lieutenant Maurice Franklins, says that this particular medication is prescribed to less than 200 people across the U.S., a fact that considerably reduced their list of suspects. “We knew we were looking for a man with a penis measuring less than half an inch. When we learned the accused was a dog catcher using that specific drug, it immediately rang a bell.” According to Lt. Franklins, other accusations could be added over the next few weeks as investigators are trying to determine if the accused could be behind other illegal videos. “We suspect him of being behind several hundred other videos involving everything from parrots to hamsters, even skunks. That guys is a real nutjob!” Detroit police spokesman, Lieutenant Maurice Franklins, says the accused was identified by due to his use of a rare drug for men born with micropenises. Mr. Clifton now faces a total of 1561 criminal charges, including bestiality and animal cruelty, as well as production, distribution, and possession of illegal pornographic material. His lawyer, Mr. Robert Fitgerald, has already announced his intention of demanding a psychiatric evaluation, claiming his client suffers from “severe mental problems that make him unfit to stand trial”. The prosecution will probably accept that request, as Mr. Clifton is known for mental health problems and already spent more than 5 years in psychiatric instituti0ns.",1

According to the city’s police department, many clues collected on the site suggest that he might have been the victim of an elaborate murder plot. “The police forces have only been able to proceed to preliminary analysis before we spotted a source of radiations on the scene and had to call a decontamination team” explains Sven Munger of the Zurich Police Department. “We can confirm that the radioactive agent is a very rare Russian product named TCDD Dioxin. The clues we have collected are insufficient to pronounce a definitive conclusion, but the complexity of the of plot we have exposed greatly reduces the number of suspects.” The victim had attracted a lot of attention from the Russian government and media in 2011 when he had written a book entitled “Я был любовник Путина” (“I was Putin’s Lover“), which was taken off the shelves before the official release, after a presidential decree. A warrant demanding the arrest of the author was also issued across Russia, leading him to file a demand for political asylum from the Helvetic state. Many sources also claim that Mr. Michaelevitch had dinner with an attaché of the Russian embassy five days before his body was found, a case strangely similar to that of the former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko in 1999.",1

According to the Cleveland Police Department, 44-year George Murphy was controlled by patrollers around midnight while he was driving his 2009 Ford Explorer. The officers reported he had been driving erratically and suspected him of being under the influence of alcohol. During a press conference this morning, Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams described the unusual scene that took place when Mr Murphy was asked to use the breathalyzer. “The accused pretended he was going to breathe in it, but then he grabbed it, put it in his mouth and swallowed it whole.” According to Chief Williams, the 44-year old electrician ate the device on purpose to avoid being accused of DUI. “As soon as he swallowed it, he started taunting the officers. He kept repeating he was invincible and that they couldn’t accuse him of anything.” Unfortunately for him, Mr Murphy’s plan didn’t go quite as planned and he was immediately arrested. A blood test was finally done at the police station and revealed he had a blood alcohol content of 0.46%, more than five times the allowed limit. The Cleveland police chief warned that eating or destroying a breathalyzer is a crime in the United States and shouldn’t be attempted. George Murphy now faces a total of nine criminal charges, including driving under the influence of alcohol, refusal to take a preliminary breath test and hindering police officers in the execution of their duties. The 44-year old has already been convicted twice for DUI in 2004 and 2013 and had only recently recovered the right to drive. If found guilty on all charges, he could spend up to five years in jail and have his driver’s license revoked for ten years.",1

It wasn’t until I saw a Youtube video of him singing during a karaoke night in a bar while he was supposed to be at a meeting for a charity, that I understood everything.”Mr. Dawson’s lawyer, Robert Sanchez, admits his client faked being deaf but said he did it “for his wife”, adding “it’s the only way to endure that annoying magpie”. Mr. Dawson’s lawyer, Robert Sanchez, claims the elderly man’s stratagem was not meant to offend or cheat his spouse, and that it may, in fact, explain why their marriage worked for 62 years. “My client is pretty quiet and not very talkative, but his wife is annoyingly chatty. If he hadn’t faked being deaf, they would have divorced 60 years ago.

The volunteers were completely astonished when the two arrestees pulled out CIA ID cards and explained they were actually carrying the drug as part of their duties and that the cargo belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency. The incident took place last night, in the Chihuahuan desert, near the Texan city of El Paso. A group of seven Minutemen saw a large black SUV drive rapidly across the border. They chased the vehicle in their own trucks and achieved to immobilize it after a chase of more than 15 miles. The vigilantes arrested the two men on board and called the border patrol, who proceeded to search the vehicle. They discovered dozens of packages of cocaine, totaling an incredible 618.4 kilograms (1363 pounds). The search of the vehicle revealed 36 packages of cocaine, all marked with the symbol of the Sinaloa Cartel, representing a black scorpion. The two men claim to be CIA operatives based in Mexico and explained that the drug was actually part of an operation of the agency. They presented identity cards that seem to validate their claim, but the CIA spokesperson, Dean Boyd, has officially denied any link between the organization and the two men. “The CIA doesn’t take part in drug smuggling operations at the US-Mexican border” said M. Boyd. “I do not know, for now, if the men are actually affiliated to the agency in any way, but I can tell you the cocaine doesn’t belong to the CIA.”Both the border patrol officers and minutemen seem unconvinced, however, and many of them seem to believe that the secret service agency is hiding something. The U.S. custom services have even announced a thorough investigation to try and verify the two men’s story. “Both of them had valid accreditations and a receipt for their cargo” says Shawn Francis Miller, spokesman of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection for the El Paso sector. “What drug dealer in his right mind, demands a receipt for 1300 pounds of cocaine? There is really something strange about these guys, and we believe the CIA possibly knows more than what it is ready to admit.” The custom services have confirmed that the two men, who can’t be identified due to the Intelligence Identities and Protection Act of 1982, did carry valid CIA identifications and that the vehicle was indeed registered as a service vehicle of the organization. The two men remain under the custody of the customs services at the moment and are still being interrogated in a facility near El Paso. They are facing charges of possessing, trafficking and importing illegal drugs, and could face other criminal charges once the investigation is over. Both the FBI and the DEA have announced that they would collaborate with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection in this case, which as already attracted a lot of attention in Southern Texas.",1

I thought I just had three balls but I was, in fact, a Siamese twin!”Mr. Wong says he was surprised by the news, but that he was somehow aware of his brother’s presence. “In a way, I always knew I had someone by my side all the time.

Four other cases have been recorded in the U.S. alone over the last twenty years and over 20 others across the globe, but all other cases involve people living less than 7 years without knowledge of their condition.

According to his colleagues, 51-year old Marty Daughtry was visibly intoxicated this morning when he showed up to work, but that was not unusual for the demolition team foreman. Recognized as an expert in his domain, Mr. Daughtry has led several major demolition projects over the years. He is known to have a severe alcohol problem but is usually able to get the job done, so his coworkers were still confident when they decided to let him manage the demolition of a 6-story apartment building. Unfortunately, Mr. Daughtry was unable to remain concentrated on the job at hand and had his employees set the explosive in the wrong building, leading to the demolition of an entirely occupied 36-apartment building. Fortunately, there was no one inside at the time, but the mistake has left dozens of families homeless and caused over $4.5 million in damage. Greenville Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Gary Walters commented the incident in a press conference a few hours after the arrest. “The accused was too drunk to pay attention and he didn’t even get the address right. It’s a miracle that all 36 apartments were vacant when the guys blew it up. That drunkard could really have killed several people!” Lieutenant Walters says the accused was so drunk at the time of his arrest that he vomited several times in the patrol car on the way to the station, before falling asleep. Marty Daughtry now faces a total of 98 criminal charges, including 79 charges of criminal neglect endangering the life of others, on for each of the destroyed building’s tenants. If found guilty on all charges, he could face a fine of $3,450,000 and a sentence of up to 425 years in prison. He is expected to appear in court in March for the beginning of his trial.",1

Hundreds of passengers were standing on the top deck at the time, and many were hit by ice projectiles weighing up to 10 lbs. Janis Garrison, a passenger who witnessed the whole incident, says the ice appeared very suddenly and took everyone by surprise. “Large chunks of ice appeared out of nowhere and began falling everywhere. It happened so fast that many people were hurt without knowing what hit them.” Five passengers were critically injured and 18 more were severely hurt, but the ship’s medical staff intervened rapidly and was able to stabilize all of the victims. The ship was rapidly redirected to Hawaii to undergo some repair and to allow the injured passengers to obtain better medical care. Some of them could need weeks of care before they can go back to their regular life. planetoilet3 25-year old Jason Matthews was hit by a 12-lb chunk of ice and suffered a severe concussion. He still has no memory of the incident. North Pacific Cruise Lines, who own and operate the Lady of the Pacific, confirmed they would file a lawsuit against the Taiwanese airline.

He received the brain of a 37-year old woman who had died in a car accident and the operation had unforeseen consequences for the poor man. After several weeks of re-education, he was finally released from the hospital two weeks ago and returned to work. But the truck driver who had never had an accident in his life says he literally forgot how to drive. “It’s strange because I’m able to speak, walk and do everything normally, but for some reason, driving is simply impossible. I had five accidents in less than two weeks. I use to drive semi trucks without problems, but now even parallel parking beyond my abilities.”Mr. Robertson says the surgery has also totally changed his personality and his outlook on life. “Since the surgery, I feel like complaining all the time. I even surprised myself thinking that I looked fat when I looked at myself in the mirror. This surgery turned me into a woman.” Dr. James Ford who performed the transplant says that minor changes in the patient’s skills or personality are normal after such a major surgery, but should gradually resorb over time. According to the doctor who treated Mr. Robertson, he should regain his lost abilities and his old personality over the next few months, but they admit that there is a small risk that some of these changes could be permanent. Dr. Ford says there is approximately a 5% chance that Mr. Robertson will be unable to “overwrite” the brain’s former knowledge, but that he normally should be able to adapt and recover over time. He estimates that this adaptation process could take between six and 18 months before he is totally back to his former self.",1

The Kalamazoo Herald revealed yesterday that the director of BLM for the state of Michigan, known as Jamal Brown, was actually 53-year old Maurice Clark, a Caucasian former bank manager from Detroit. Mr. Clark apparently began using tan injections on himself in 2011, a few months after losing his job at the Bank of America. When interviewed by the newspaper, his former neighbors revealed that he began behaving strangely at the time and using stereotypical “gangsta rap” expressions. “He matched all the clichés. He was acting more African-American, than any African-American I’ve ever met.”Mr. Clark moved to Kalamazoo in January 2012 and assumed the identity of Jamal Brown. In a matter of months, the dynamic and capable man was occupying important positions in various civil rights organizations across Michigan. In 2013, he was one of the founders of the Kalamazoo chapter of Black Lives Matter and has gained much influence within the organization since that time. BLM named Jamal Brown as general director for the state of Michigan in 2014 and he had played that role even since. BlackLivesMatterLeader2 Local leaders of the Kalamazoo BLM chapter reacted to Mr.Clark/Brown’s resignation, saying it was a “personal decision” and that the movement did not ask him to quit. The last few months had been quite hectic for the activist after some attacks on his legitimacy began to surface. In December 2016, a first wave of rumors concerning his origins began to circulate on the social media, leading some reporters to investigate. In April, the Kalamazoo Herald published a series of articles revealing the Jamal Brown was a fabricated identity and that he wasn’t who he pretended to be. Finally, yesterday morning, the same newspaper revealed that it had discovered Mr. Brown’s true identity, publishing fourteen pages of documents to confirm its claim. According to these documents, the activist used regular melatonin injections to keep his skin pigmentation dark and protect his fake identity. The BLM leader didn’t deny the allegations and published a short message on Facebook in which he asks for forgiveness and resigns from his position. “I always wanted to be black, so I used some tan injections to fit in. I’m sorry if I hurt anyone, but I just didn’t want to be white anymore.”Mr. Clark said he would not make any more comments on his resignation and has refused all demands for interviews.Despite the apparent identity fraud, a spokesperson of Black Lives Matter said the organization held no grudge against its former leader and announced that it would not file any accusations against him.",1

The recent disappearance of domestic animals in the neighborhood started to arise suspicion from local residents when some people started to notice the old lady’s particular fur coats, some even recognizing their cats in the coat’s furs, a fact the lady vehemently denied before being caught on videotape by a private detective hired by local residents to follow the suspicious lady. It is believed the old lady started at first to raise her own cats but finally decided to capture neighboring cats because she “got too much attached to the little critters”, she admitted in court. It is estimated she used over 30 cats to make one single fur coat and over 20 fur coats were found in her house during the arrest A cruel operation The retired fashion designer lured neighborhood cats with food and skinned them in her basement where she dried the skins. She also used the meat of the cats to lure other cats who unwittingly were eating their own species, a disgusting and cruel hobby admits local PETA spokeswoman Jane Churchill. “I can’t believe these atrocities happened in our own backyard.

Latifah Smith-Nabengana says she was visited by an “Angel of God” in July 2017, who told her that she had been chosen to bear the Christ’s son. “He told me that he was a Nephilim, like those described in the Bible,” explained the young girl. “He told that he had a message from Jesus, He said that I was going to be pregnant, and that I would give birth to a son, Jesus’ son.” Nephilims are indeed mythical creatures mentioned in the Genesis 6:4: “The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward when the sons of God came into the daughters of men, and they bore children to them. Those were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown.” This type of creature has been almost unheard of over the last few thousand years, so the teenager’s claim has surprised everyone in her family when she announced it to them. Being very religious themselves, they rapidly accepted her claim and showed flawless support for the 15-year old. The medical doctor who has been following her pregnancy, Dr. William Franklin Murphy, says he is aware of his patient’s version but is unable to either confirm or invalidate her claims. “For all I know, her pregnancy seems normal,” claims the gynecologist. “Her claims of “Virgin pregnancy” are technically true, but that doesn’t mean there was a divine intervention. I can tell you that it’s a boy, but there no way for me to determine if it is Jesus’ son until he is born. If she asks for a DNA test at that time, then we can tell you who the father is.” Due to laws concerning medical secrets, Dr. Murphy refused to discuss any details concerning the young woman’s pregnancy but said it didn’t really have anything really unusual except her apparent virginity.The teenager’s claim has stirred quite a controversy that has reached far beyond her religious community.While most people have shown their support to Ms. Smith-Nabengana, others have launched various accusations on the social media, ranging from fabricating the whole story to sleeping with a demonic creature known as an incubus. Latifah Smith-Nabengana says she wants to demand a paternity test as soon as her son is born, to prove that she is telling the truth.

While arriving at work in the morning, Seaworld employees found 17 dead penguins and 12 other severely injured ones, at the foot of a 30-foot high wall. An independent investigation was ordered to determine the cause of these mysterious deaths, and the experts have made their conclusions public yesterday. According to the 26-page report,  the penguins suffered from severe depression, caused by their “inhumane living conditions”. The marine biologists and veterinarian pathologists concluded that the penguins had chosen to commit suicide “in order to put an end to their pain and suffering”. The corporate curator for Zoological Operations at all SeaWorld Parks, Chuck Tompkins, met reporters this morning to react to report, which he called a “deceitful and biased piece of shit”. “The living conditions of all penguins in our marine parks are absolutely exemplary,” said Mr Tompkins. “They are well-fed and have a large enclosure with a pool and everything… Anyways, let’s be honest, penguins are like chicken, they’re not smart enough to be suicidal! These so-called experts are clearly animal right extremists who want to close all zoos and marine parks.”Seaworld’s corporate curator, Chuck Tompkins, dismissed the report as fallacious, insisting that birds were unable of being suicidal. This new incident occurs at a really bad moment for Seaworld, which is already struggling to maintain a positive public image. The corporation has been in the crosshairs of animal rights activists and has experienced a drop in revenue since the release of the documentary Blackfish, in 2013. The movie chronicled the case of Tilikum, a killer whale that caused the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, in 2010. Three of Seaworld’s famous orcas have also died over the last six months, and all of them were still very young, considering their 100-year life expectancy. The last to date is 18-year-old Unna, who died from a rare fungal infection last week, causing reactions from many animal rights organizations.",1

She reportedly tackled the young man and held him on the ground while stapling his lips more than 45 times. Amanda Jones, one of the victim’s classmates who witnessed the whole incident, says that the teacher “completely lost it” after the young man made a joke about her weight. “She was just enraged! She yelled ‘This will shut you up, you little fucker!’ and just jumped on him. She held him down and then she began stapling his lips over and over again.”Another witness, Justin Reynolds, says he tried to help his classmate, but was kicked by the infuriated teacher. “I tried to pull her off Jeremy and the first time she violently pushed me away. When I tried again, she kicked me in the guts with her high heels.”Fortunately, two officers of the Springfield Missouri Police Department were already on the site and Ms Fransen was arrested less than five minutes after the beginning of the assault. A dozen police officers were mobilized to Central High School after the incident in order to collect the testimonies of the numerous witnesses. Ms Fransen now faces a total of 21 criminal charges, including 5 charges of aggravated assault, and could now face up to 110 years in jail. Her lawyer, Robert Monroe, says that her violent reaction was due to the fact that she was being harassed by Mr Dunlop on a regular basis. Mr Monroe claims that Ms Fransen is in fact the victim in this story, and that she “temporarily lost contact with reality” as a result of the harassment. She is expected to appear in court in May, but her lawyer has already announced that she would plea “not guilty”.",1

Marleen Freeman, 38, a Coast Guard employee for the past 12 years, told South Portland police officers that the government shutdown left her with no other choice but to prostitute herself to put food on the table. Freeman was also found in the possession of crystal meth, crack cocaine, anabolic steroids, PCP and methamphetamines which she also admitted to selling to take care of her unemployed husband as well as her three young children. “We discussed selling her kidneys but someone told us it could be dangerous for her health” her husband, Tyrone Freeman, told reporters. Husband Tyrone Freeman told reporters he felt devastated after his wife, Marleen Freeman, was arrested during a prostitution sting operation by South Portland police. “She is the sole provider of our family and when she proposed to sell her body to pay the bills, I refused, but then we realized it was our only choice,” he told reporters, visibly shattered. Tyrone Freeman says he doesn’t have the money to pay the $10,000 bail for his wife, and that he has no idea how he will feed his three children who are aged 8, 6 and 3. “I had a job as a video game tester for 18 months but then I started having pain in one of my wrists and have since been unemployed for the past three years,” he acknowledges.

The famous Seychelles giant tortoise lived on the grounds of Plantation House, the official residence of the island’s Governor, and belonged to the government of Saint Helena since 1882. According to the Saint Helena Police Service, 47-year old Margaret Sanders was visiting Plantation House with her family when her legs began to hurt and she needed to rest. The 520-lbs woman began looking for a place to sit down, and unfortunately confused the venerable animal with a decorative bench and decided to sit on it. Ms. Sanders’ weight was too important for the tortoise’s carapace and it immediately began cracking up, crushing the animal underneath. The site’s veterinarian, Dr. Frank Hollins, arrived less than a minute later, but Jonathan had already died of suffocation. Dr. Hollins was visibly emotional when he described the scene in an interview with the BBC, only hours after the incident. “When I saw that fat Lady on Jonathan, I started cursing and swearing at her, I couldn’t help myself. She just stared at me with a blank stare. It took minutes before she realized that her ‘bench’ was bleeding.” The veterinarian describes Jonathan’s death as a great loss for Saint Helena and the entire world. “Animals who live that old are extremely rare. It’s a catastrophe to have a nearly 200-year old animal die because of human stupidity.” Dr. Hollins spent the last 32 years of his life caring for Jonathan and other tortoises on the Plantation House property. He described the 185-year old tortoise’s death as a great loss for the world. Jonathan was famous around the world as the oldest known land animal and had already appeared in several media over his very long life. The elderly tortoise was both a member of an endangered species, a major tourist attraction and a government property, so Margaret Sanders was immediately arrested and detained by the island’s police. She could face a variety of criminal charges, including the reckless destruction of government property, animal cruelty and even poaching. The Saint Helena Police Service has confirmed that multiple accusations should be filed over the next few days, once investigators have met with all witnesses of the incident.",1

Hank Wyatt, 53, is suing the state of Alabama claiming the will of his great-great-grandfather, William Hugh Patton, has been illegally nullified by current state judges. Hank Wyatt recently came into possession of a document dating from 1865 previously owned by his great-great-grandfather, William Hugh Patton, which claims he legally bought four “negro” prisoners from the state of Alabama. The 153-year-old document signed by the Governor of Alabama at the time, Thomas H. Watts, boldly states that William Hugh Patton is given ownership over the aforementioned prisoners as well as to all of their descendants. “I ain’t saying I want those people’s descendants to be my slaves. I just want a financial compensation, because legally, I own them,” Hank Wyatt told reporters. Hank Wyatt’s attorney, Robert Lindsay, claims his client is entitled to a financial compensation since the document’s authenticity has been proven and complies with current federal laws. “My client’s demands clearly comply with current federal laws and the State of Alabama has the obligation of compensating my client for refusing to honor this contract,” attorney Robert Lindsay explained. The Thirteen amendment to the United States Constitution declared slavery and involuntary servitude illegal in 1865, except as a punishment for criminality.

"343","https://newspunch.com/broward-county-sheriff-fired/","anonymous","Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting. According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week. From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said. According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed. The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week. Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting. It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL. Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy. In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying. Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates. Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?” The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history. During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment. “I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said. “Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said. Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country. In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.",1

Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case. The St. Louis Circuit Attorney has contrived a case against Gov. Greitens that Lewis Carroll would have been hard pressed to imagine The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange. When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.” The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?” K.S. replied, “Correct.” The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?” K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.” Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?” Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.” K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case. As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.

It was nine months late when the same paper reported that Obama’s border agents were tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment. It was called the Juvenile Referral Process, and it worried human rights groups Mexican officials who feared that it put the kids at risk. The program was the creation of Robert Harris who at the time U.S. Customs and Border Protection commander of the Laredo sector. Harris believed holding certain young Mexicans, believed to be working for cartels in detention serves to get these kids out of the smuggling enterprise. Believed is the operative word,  There were no judges, no charges– no trial–just belief. His intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of the guides smuggling other migrants were Mexicans younger than 18 — teenagers often hired or conscripted by drug cartels that knew they would not be prosecuted if caught — and he wanted to attack this loophole. Trending: U.S. ‘Founded By Genocide’ Says Ilhan Omar “Why don’t we remove these juveniles from the smuggling cycle?” Harris, the outgoing commander of the Laredo sector of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, recalled thinking. take our poll - story continues below Should Joe Biden drop out of the Presidential race because of his inappropriate touching of women? Now, as a result of that decision, young Mexicans are being held for months without charge in shelters across the United States, sometimes without their parents’ knowledge. Since the program began in May, 536 juveniles have been held — 248 of whom have been deported to Mexico after an average stay of 75 days, according to Border Patrol statistics. Mexican authorities say some of these repeat border-crossers have spent as much as six months in U.S. custody while they await an appearance before an immigration judge. During their detention, they are questioned by U.S. authorities and then transferred to a network of facilities run by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, across 15 states. Lets put this in perspective, under Trump children are separated from their parents because they don’t want the kids going to jail with their parents.  Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in “facilities” so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels. “Our concern is that the program’s real intent is to interrogate the kids,” said Maureen Meyer, an expert on Mexico and migrants at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA). The kids are “often questioned about the criminal groups they are working for and then subsequently returned to Mexico with no apparent concern about the implications for them.” While in custody last year [2014], one Mexican boy who worked as a guide shared information with U.S. authorities about the location of stash houses used by migrants as they move through the United States, according to his lawyer’s written summary of his case. When he returned to Mexico, he learned that armed men had forced their way into his home and killed a relative’s son. The men told the family that there had been raids on cartel hideouts and arrests and that they believed the boy was responsible. His half-brother was later killed by the same group. The boy, his lawyer said, has since been in hiding. Harris said the Border Patrol does not have a system to track what happens to the juveniles once they return to Mexico. The program does appear to be discouraging them from returning illegally to Texas, he said. The patrol calculates that just 7 percent of the children who have gone through the program has been picked up again crossing the border. But the program was a surprise to Mexico “The moment it started, it took us all by surprise, because there wasn’t an announcement,” said Reyna Torres Mendívil, director general of the Mexican Foreign Ministry’s office for protection of Mexicans abroad. “Where were they taking these children?” Regarding preventing kids from becoming repeat offenders, the Juvenile Referral Process worked, But why is it okay to incarcerate kids based on a belief without a judge or knowledge of their parents? The only reason I can think of is that a program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered unAmerican when the president is a Republican. Note: The picture in the post may or may not be of the Mexican children discussed above. Based on the Washington Post we know that the detention center in McAllen, TX was one of the locations used and July 2014 is during the active period of the Juvenile Referral Process.",1

During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the Vatican’s guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible. “Jesus Christ, Mohammed, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths.

In October of 2015, DeLisle was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims. The men, Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu, were already wanted for a crime spree that spanned nearly four years with dozens of victims. They preyed on older Americans, often grabbing them off the street to beat and rob them. Until they met DeLisle.Now, Hallalla is in a wheelchair breathing through a tube and Salabu is dead. DeLisle, who stormed the beach at Normandy as a young man, responded to the young men like any good Marine would. He pulled a .22 from his ankle holster — which is “illegal” in California — and put both men down in seconds. Prosecutors said that because the two men were unarmed and using threats instead of actually hurting DeLisle meant that there was no imminent danger and that the use of deadly force was “extreme and unnecessary.” The Dewey County Prosecutor explained in a press release: “Mr. DeLisle could have handed over his wallet without incident. Instead, he chose to pull an illegally carried firearm from a concealed location and shot the two men. Had he stopped there it may not have been such a major incident, as both men’s initial wounds were superficial. While they were on the ground, DeLisle told Salabu that if he didn’t ‘denounce his pagan moon god, Allah, that he would be meeting him. Salabu closed his eyes to pray and DeLisle put two bullets in his skull. Hallalla, after seeing his friend murdered, tried to flee and was shot in the spine, paralizing him for life. This wasn’t self-defense. It was murder and religious persecution.” Religious persecution? How much you want to bet if the tables were turned and an elderly Muslim killed two Christian men trying to mug him he’d get a medal from the Governor of California? DeLisle has nothing to be concerned with, since the pansies in California don’t actually execute prisoners. They have a moratorium on their useless death penalty and have for decades. He will, however, die in prison. His lawyer said DeLisle expressed that it was a “small price to pay if he saved others from these two monsters.” DeLisle hasn’t asked for an appeal.",1

Unsurprisingly, the suspect — a who goes by the name Isus Krist — is a man of Middle Eastern descent. Krist is a known organizer who operates out of the area surrounding Palestine. French police released this sketch, calling Krist “highly dangerous”: Krist is dark in complexion and is often seen preaching his wicked doctrine. But he has a dark, dangerous side and has been involved in other terrorist attacks. We first heard of Krist when it became known that he had formed a hard-knit terror cell consisting of 12 accomplices, who have committed many acts in his name. Krist himself made headlines last year when he entered a church and began destroying property because he claimed that the “church is stealing from the people.” He has even been known to attack money changers at various events. He and his followers justify this by calling material wealth and money “inherently evil things.” Krist was last seen riding a donkey and wearing a robe and sandals in the desert, but police admit that they are not sure where he is right now. “We are certain he has left the country,” says Notre Dame police captain Dolce de Leche. “He is now regarded as one of France’s most wanted terrorists.” Police are urging anyone who has seen him in any country to contact law enforcement.

But he was not doing any of these things. Quite the opposite, in fact. Inside sources have told Daily World Update that, upon hearing about the out of control blaze, Pope Francis began to laugh and dance on his papal balcony , shocking onlookers in Vatican Square below. Is this Francis’ true identity? Must be. This picture is on the Internet. Those same anonymous sources have hinted about why the pope reacted in such an unexpected way.  It seems there had been rumblings and rumors in the  Vatican about a reporter who was making some dark and disturbing claims. He said he “knew where the church’s bodies were buried.” And he wasn’t being figurative.  He suggested he had actual evidence of real bodies hidden within the cathedral. He further proffered that the bodies belonged to what the Jesuits had called “enemies of the church who sought to reveal secrets best left forgotten.” It’s unknown what these “secrets” are but the Catholic Church has had its share of scandals over the years. From heresy trials, to pillaging of riches, to the abuse of children by the clergy, dark times have abounded. These alleged victims could have been ready to expose the church in an infinite number of ways. Could this be the scandal the church wants to hide?

News of the fires broke as Obama was boarding her $246,000 dinner cruise along the Sac de Coq river. But instead of canceling her trip, she got on board anyway and had a great time. Eyewitnesses report that Obama was “laughing and having a good time as the Cathedral burned.” One of her fellow passengers told Breitbart News that Obama was laughing and joking about the devastating inferno: According to a source who wishes to remain anonymous, Obama was cracking jokes about the fire. “Not my problem,” she was overheard telling a woman as Obama took a sip of wine. “Why should I care if that whole corrupt temple burns to the ground?” This was apparently in reference to the Catholic nature of the building.  The report goes on to say: Obama then suggested a “drinking game” where everyone takes a sip of wine every time a “window blows out of that blight on humanity.” Unsurprisingly, there were not any takers. Witnesses say that the former First Lady was “visibly drunk” and was “observed bursting into laughter while watching news reports.” “What is it Christians say?” she told one man — a member of the French press — over dinner. “Everything happens for a reason, and this is apparently God’s plan for the building.” This part is surprising since Obama regularly claims to be a Christian. However, she has regularly been accused of being a Muslamic. This seems to finally be an admission of that. Other reports accuse Obama of saying that she doesn’t “care what happens in Nova Scotia” — apparently mistakenly believing that the cathedral was not in Paris, but in another country altogether.

"356","https://newspunch.com/tens-of-thousands-of-scientists-declare-climate-change-a-hoax/","Sean Adl-Tabatabai","A staggering 30,000 scientists have come forward confirming that man-made climate change is a hoax perpetuated by the elite in order to make money. One of the experts is weather channel founder, John Coleman, who warns that huge fortunes are being made by man-made climate change proponents such as Al Gore. Natural News reports: In a recent interview with Climate Depot, Coleman said: “Al Gore may emerge from the shadows to declare victory in the ‘global warming’ debate if Hillary Clinton moves into the White House. Yes, if that happens and the new climate regulations become the law of the land, they will be next to impossible to overturn for four to eight years.” Climate change proponents remain undeterred in their mission, ignoring numerous recent scientific findings indicating that there has been no warming trend at all for nearly two decades. Al Gore’s dire predictions of the melting of polar ice on a massive scale have proved to be completely false. In fact, in 2014 – a year that was touted as being “the hottest ever” in the Earth’s history – there were record amounts of ice reported in Antarctica, an increase in Arctic ice, and record snowfalls across the globe. Debunking the “97 percent” lie On top of those “inconvenient truths,” the White House’s assertion that 97 percent of scientists agree that global warming is real has been completely debunked. Several independently-researched examinations of the literature used to support the “97 percent” statement found that the conclusions were cherry-picked and misleading. More objective surveys have revealed that there is a far greater diversity of opinion among scientists than the global warming crowd would like for you to believe. From the National Review: “A 2008 survey by two German scientists, Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch, found that a significant number of scientists were skeptical of the ability of existing global climate models to accurately predict global temperatures, precipitation, sea-level changes, or extreme weather events even over a decade; they were far more skeptical as the time horizon increased.” Other mainstream news sources besides the National Review have also been courageous enough to speak out against the global warming propaganda – even the Wall Street Journal published an op-ed piece in 2015 challenging the Anthropogenic Global Warming (AGW) pseudoscience being promulgated by global warming proponents. And, of course, there are the more than 31,000 American scientists (to date) who have signed a petition challenging the climate change narrative and 9,029 of them hold PhDs in their respective fields. But hey, Al Gore and his cronies have also ignored that inconvenient truth, as well. Many of those scientists who signed the petition were likely encouraged to speak out in favor of the truth after retired senior NASA atmospheric scientist John L. Casey revealed that solar cycles are largely responsible for warming periods on Earth – not human activity. Al Gore and cronies continue getting richer from the global warming hoax But the global warming crowd continues to push their agenda on the public while lining their pockets in the process. If you’re still inclined to believe what Al Gore has to say about global warming, please consider the fact that since he embarked on his crusade, his wealth has grown from $2 million in 2001 to $100 million in 2016 – largely due to investments in fake “green tech” companies and the effective embezzlement of numerous grants and loans.

Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order. The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion. Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook.

Update: This article, published on July 15 2018, originally alleged that San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz was the Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds. This was incorrect. According to a DOJ press release from July 5 of this year, it was the mayor of the municipality of Sabana Grande, Miguel G. Ortiz-Vélez, who had “been indicted and arrested for his participation in a conspiracy to steal federal funds involving fraudulently obtained contracts from the PR Department of Education.”Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and huge amounts of money to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still openly criticized the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative. As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.“What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president. Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October. Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it. According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption. Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster. “The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported. “U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued. “Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added. Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees. At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States. Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised? There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny. “Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,” the AP confirmed. The hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident. However, it’s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn’t point to Donald Trump … it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.",1

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets. In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk. Hodges says he has no regrets. He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe. Hodges had worked for the CIA. Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America. He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives. Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth. He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States. Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated. “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!” Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate (a very powerful sedative) that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death. The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations. The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead. This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage?

An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say. The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds — literally. This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name “Alexi Jonesinov”) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President. However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with. It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome. It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space. “We have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,” one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people’s actions as “Russian neuro-brain hacking.” When asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were “ridiculous,” “outrageous” and “goofy.” However, Peskov suspiciously asked “vere is Moose and Squirrel?” NSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people’s brains, he’s “never seen anything on this scale before.” The Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road. You are all nuts…almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don’t matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven’t noticed, Trump’s people have most of the guns.",1

McCain called the Australian ambassador, to pass on a message to Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull that might be a violation of the Logan Act. The law prevents citizens from interfering in disputes the United States is having with foreign countries. The Senator stated that Australia is one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies and in that spirit, he called Australia’s Ambassador to the United States to express his unwavering support for the U.S.-Australia alliance. According to the Logan Act, any citizen of the United States who “without permission of the United States” either directly or indirectly “commences or carries on correspondence” with any foreign government or any officer of another government, to “influence the measures or conduct of any foreign government or of any officer” in ongoing controversies or disputes with America, shall be fined or sent to prison for three years– or both. McCain claimed that he asked Ambassador Hockey to convey to the people of Australia that their American brothers and sisters value our historic alliance, honor the sacrifice of the Australians who have served and are serving by our side, and remain committed to the safer, freer, and better world that Australia does far more than its fair share to protect and promote. Even if McCain is still the sitting Senator from Arizona, that does not exempt him from the dictates of the Logan Act. Among the conflicting reports by CNN about the conversation between Trump and his Australian counterpart, Senator McCain called to offer his “unwavering support” to the foreign leader. Former President Barack Obama created the deal shortly before leaving the office. Australia had denied access to the immigrants based upon security concerns and would not have refused entry to the refugees and detained them offshore without a valid reason.

"366","http://patriotcrier.com/1-6kk-0/","anonymous","ELDER PATRIOT – New evidence has been uncovered by a private investigator that proves Jim Comey was a dirty cop who had to go. After former DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered his family asked people to stop speculating about his involvements and to respect their privacy. At the time many of us connected the Wikileaks revelations to his death and concluded he was killed to send a message to other would be leakers by people within the DNC or from within the Clinton campaign.  Of course we were dismissed as conspiracy theorists. Now it has been reported that former D.C. homicide detective Rod Wheeler had been hired by Rich’s family to run a parallel investigation to the one being conducted by the F.B.I. Both the D.C. police and the F.B.I. had been involved but Wheeler revealed that neither, “The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming.  They haven’t been cooperating at all.  Wheeler also confirmed that his sources have told him that “absolutely” there is information on Rich’s laptop that links Rich to Wikileaks. Wheeler also was told by his source inside the D.C. Police Department, “Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.”  According to Wheeler, “That is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department.  Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor’s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out.” [Tuesday]. It’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement but the fact is the F.B.I. has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three. Comey’s contention that the DNC server contained proof that Russia hackers affected the election is falling apart as we watch the mad scramble that is ensuing following the recent ransomware attacks. In explained the ransomware attack, experts are shooting holes in Comey’s claim that the F.B.I. is capable of tracking attacks backwards. Hector Monsegur, Director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Labs and a former computer hacker who had been arrested by the FBI informant before turning informant said: “Attribution is probably the hardest thing the FBI is dealing with here.” “It’s nearly impossible because you have various hackers from pretty much anywhere. Also, they are aware of techniques to track them down. So you could have an Egyptian hacker who uses Russian software so it looks like it’s Russian but is actually from Egypt.” Comey was definitive that Russia had hacked the DNC’s computers with the intention of helping Donald Trump get elected.  Here’s what we’ve learned since Comey made that declaration to congress: The F.B.I. never did a forensic examination of the DNC servers.  Instead they took the word of the company the DNC hired to look into it. Experts, ones who worked for the F.B.I., admit that attribution is nearly impossible even if you are in possession of the computers that were hacked. Comey “concluded” that Hillary Clinton did not intend to commit espionage despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary but that the Russians intended to help Donald Trump without presenting a single shred of evidence that the Russians were even involved. Revelations such as this continue to surface.  They are the reason that former Federal Prosecutor Joseph DiGenova said of Comey, “he’s a dirty cop.” Comey had to go and President Trump did the right thing in firing him.  Contrary to the talking points coming out of the D.C. swamp, Trump gave Comey every opportunity to prove his fealty to the law once he had been freed from the constraints put on him by Obama and Loretta Lynch.  When Comey continued protecting known criminal behavior to save the swamp he left Donald Trump no choice but to fire him. America deserves an F.B.I. director who is determined to prosecute criminal behavior no matter where he finds it.",1
"367","http://patriotcrier.com/proof-president-obama-hillary-clinton-leading-democrats-terrorists/","anonymous","ELDER PATRIOT – Before Barack Obama was ever elected president he called for a “national security force” just as strong as our military:Give that some thought for just a minute.  Our military is the most powerful on earth.  What was Obama planning that would precipitate the need for that kind of force projection against the American people? This didn’t turn out to be an idle campaign promise either as credible news sources here and here and here have reported years after having been reported years earlier by Infowars and other alternative news outlets among them secretsofthefed.com. Armed with the power of overwhelming force Obama ordered the IRS to intimidate his political enemies.  Control of the IRS investigatory process has allowed Obama’s political friends and donors to avoid even the threat of prosecution for wrong-doing while, at the same time, it has silenced most of his opponents for fear of expensive audits and administrative findings of deficiencies, real or manufactured. Everywhere he has brazenly issued federal diktats designed to undermine our Constitution and Founding Principles under the guise of advancing social justice.  This included rewriting laws covering everything from land management, to healthcare, to environmental protection, to property rights and everything in between.  The result has amounted to nothing short of a war on our nation’s economy. This war on our economy has resulted in more unemployed Americans than at anytime in our history and these people are increasingly dependent on government for their survival. Beyond all of this, Obama has sowed the seeds of and nurtured racial divisions almost since the day he took office.  Over the past two plus years the president has more brazenly peddled his racist divisiveness as explained by Mark Levin. “The next pillar of freedom to be destroyed will be accomplished with the completion of an incredibly complex and intense data bases that the Obama administration is building and that has been kept secret until now.  The NY Post is reporting that these databases will be of massive proportions and will maintain every minute personal detail about you and everyone else.  The plan is to be able to use this information to justify legislation and executive orders intended to achieve desired political outcomes. “For the Obama administration it will be used to justify the balancing of racial outcomes.  Already, banks whose portfolios that don’t have enough prime loans to minorities; schools that suspend too many blacks whether warranted or not; municipalities that don’t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds have had “disparate impact” cases brought against them. How Obama will use federal departments from Housing and Urban Development, to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, to the Department of Education is outlined in detail by the tothedeathmedia.com expose. The catalyst for foisting this on the American people is the Black Lives Matter movement and their more militant arm, the New Black Panther Party.  This is all to be done in the name of social justice. The plan to employ racial discord was developed by Obama with the assistance of Valerie Jarrett in meetings with these groups at the White House almost a year ago.  As reported by Breitbart.com in February of this year the president praised the work of Black Lives Matter activists. Initial funding of BLM was furnished by George Soros to underwrite the Ferguson and Baltimore riots.  Almost immediately after the White House meeting in the fourth quarter of 2015, Obama’s most stridently liberal billionaire backers joined George Soros in funding this racist, divisive and terrorist group.  This was reported in detail by Politico. Steve Phillips of the radically leftist Democracy Alliance explained that the movement needed cash to build a self-sustaining infrastructure and that “the progressive donor world should be adding zeroes to their contributions that support this transformative movement.” According the article in Politico, “The Democracy Alliance was created in 2005 by a handful of major donors, including billionaire financier George Soros and Taco Bell heir Rob McKay to build a permanent infrastructure to advance liberal ideas and causes. Donors are required to donate at least $200,000 a year to recommended groups, and their combined donations to those groups now total more than $500 million.” Obama has also resorted to ordering, or allowing to be ordered, the use of terrorist tactics against the people of Ferguson, Baltimore and with the ascendancy of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign Obama has now has a greater urgency to deploy terrorist tactics. During last spring’s Black Lives Matter riot in Baltimore, Democrat Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake ordered the police to stand down while rioters caused maximum property damage.  Rawlings-Blake serves as one of only three mayors on President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing that provides her a direct line to the president on matters concerning the police.  The fact that neither party used that personal connection to demand the police put an end to hostilities proves that they shared prior complicity in aiding and abetting the civil unrest that unfolded under her watch. San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo, also a Democrat, ordered the police to stand down when Mexican nationalists and other protestors unleashed a violent wave of attacks on Trump supporters.  As U.S. citizens, Trump and his supporters have every right to expect protection from the police and the fact that Obama stood silent and did not attempt to interdict to stop this violent lawlessness from being perpetrated against fellow Americans would be unconscionable except to a person who welcomes it. But why shouldn’t we have expected this behavior by Mayor Liccardo?  After all, the Chicago police did little to prevent the shutdown of a Trump rally by violent protestors in their city prior to this event.  Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is another radical leftist Democrat who had served as Obama’s first chief of staff. Need further proof that civil disrupters will be protected at the expense of law-abiding conservatives by our Terrorist-in-Charge?  Check out Cleveland Mayor Frank G. Jackson who has told his police to “stand down” rather than confront protestors at next week’s Republican National Convention.  This has been widely reported including by the Gateway Pundit.  You guessed correctly, Jackson is a Democrat.  And, neither Obama nor Clinton have called on Jackson to order differently. What about Hillary Clinton?  Clinton’s track record is replete with terrorist ties as was reported in this article outlining Mrs. Clinton’s relationship with Huma Abedin  Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan has done outstanding investigative journalism in reporting on this subject. With Secretary of State Hillary Clinton guiding the Obama administration’s foreign policy, at least five countries in the Middle East are embroiled in what amount to wars for survival against radical Islamist terror groups. With Mrs. Clinton serving as the architect of our European foreign policy, our most dependable allies in Europe have become so threated by invading Islamic terrorists that the European Union has begun disintegrating compelled by populist uprisings that are a result of the conquering war mentality of the invading Middle Eastern marauders.  Member nations are now finding their populations demanding that their governments cut ties with the EU so that they may individually salvage what’s left of their culture and national identities. Mrs. Clinton, like President Obama, has failed to ask the protestors even a single time to end their violence against Trump and his supporters. Short of actually announcing the use of terrorism as part of their platform when they convene for the convention at the end of this month to nominate Hillary Clinton as their presidential pick, what further proof that the Democratic Party is now the domestic terrorist organization most threatening to America and her people could someone ask for?",1

Responding to a question about why he thinks President Trump has not yet fulfilled this particular campaign promise, Freeman laughed and said and looked up at the heavens before saying, “Goddamnit man, you were elected for this very reason, lock that bitch up!” After being accused of political incorrectness, Freeman laughed again, saying “It’s all about being loving and caring these days, isn’t it?“ “The most loving and caring thing we as a society can do for Hillary Clinton is lock her up where she can get professional and institutional help and prevent her hurting herself or anyone else.” The veteran actor, who remains as professionally active as at any point in his long career, cannot be accused of partisan bullying. It appears the 80-year-old star is simply a straight shooter who would prefer politicians and public figures are held to the same standards as everyone else.

While insisting that the Kremlin’s election interference is “no movie script,” and that he did not know whether the allegations were true or not, Morgan said, “we need our president to speak directly to us and tell us the truth.” “We need him to sit behind the desk in the Oval Office and say, ‘My fellow Americans.

Mark Lambert, 54, of Mount Airy, Maryland, was charged in an 11-count indictment with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and to commit wire fraud, seven counts of violating the FCPA, two counts of wire fraud and one count of international promotion money laundering. The charges stem from an alleged scheme to bribe Vadim Mikerin, a Russian official at JSC Techsnabexport (TENEX), a subsidiary of Russia’s State Atomic Energy Corporation and the sole supplier and exporter of Russian Federation uranium and uranium enrichment services to nuclear power companies worldwide, in order to secure contracts with TENEX. The case against Lambert is assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Theodore D. Chuang of the District of Maryland. According to the indictment, beginning at least as early as 2009 and continuing until October 2014, Lambert conspired with others at “Transportation Corporation A” to make corrupt and fraudulent bribery and kickback payments to offshore bank accounts associated with shell companies, at the direction of, and for the benefit of, a Russian official, Vadim Mikerin, in order to secure improper business advantages and obtain and retain business with TENEX.Image result for obama In order to effectuate and conceal the corrupt and fraudulent bribe payments, Lambert and others allegedly caused fake invoices to be prepared, purportedly from TENEX to Transportation Corporation A, that described services that were never provided, and then Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to wire the corrupt payments for those purported services to shell companies in Latvia, Cyprus and Switzerland. Lambert and others also allegedly used code words like “lucky figures,” “LF,” “lucky numbers,” and “cake” to describe the payments in emails to the Russian official at his personal email account.T he indictment also alleges that Lambert and others caused Transportation Corporation A to overbill TENEX by building the cost of the corrupt payments into their invoices, and TENEX thus overpaid for Transportation Corporation A’s services. In June 2015, Lambert’s former co-president, Daren Condrey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the FCPA and commit wire fraud, and Vadim Mikerin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering involving violations of the FCPA. Mikerin is currently serving a sentence of 48 months in prison and Condrey is awaiting sentencing.

The southern border wall with Mexico made big dust in the mainstream media.Image result for Trump’s Border Wall Has One New Feature That Enrages Mexico Trump’s executive orders on immigration and refugee resettlement didn’t go well with liberals, who fear to lose their votes by stopping the immigrants form entering United States. They were lucky to hear that the new administration will delay plans to build the wall, but unfortunately for them, Trump managed to start the program. According to Conservative Fighters: The agency in charge for the United States border plan started making prototypes on Trump’s proposal. Customs and Border Protection’s acting deputy commissioner, Ronald Vitiello announced that four to eight companies will get contracts for prototypes, for roughly 2000 miles border wall and they will have 30 days to complete the plan, as Fox News reported.Image result for Trump’s Border Wall Has One New Feature That Enrages Mexico Everyone expected that the wall would be made from simple concrete stabs, but instead, it will be ultra modern including high-tech features like solar panels. The Mexican authorities will be shocked from this decision, but all they can do is watch and pray that Trump would change his mind. The wall comes as the only solution from preventing hundreds of thousands of immigrants, illegally entering the U.S. border. Criminals, gang members, and terrorists were making American people fear for their lives for many years, and Trump wants to finally put an end. Importing drugs was the biggest problem with Mexican illegals. The drug market was increasing every year, and thousands of teenagers were getting killed in the drug cartels, previously made by the Mexican criminals.Image result for Trump’s Border Wall Has One New Feature That Enrages Mexico Many of those illegals were also taking American people’s jobs and damaging the U.S. budget by using the Welfare system for various benefits. We believe that the border wall will definitely solve the problems and our country will finally fix our broken economy and culture. Of all the wonderful things that President Donald Trump says and does, liberals are particularly triggered by his promise to build a wall on the Mexican border. Liberals hate the idea of a border wall for two reasons. First, it hurts their precious feelings. They get sad when they realize that people need to be deported in order for us to live in a nation of laws. In their minds, America is a magical place filled with candy and unicorns, where everyone is allowed to just hop in and get free stuff. Little do they know that the real world does not work this way, and that this mentality has devastated our economy.Image result for Trump’s Border Wall Has One New Feature That Enrages Mexico Second, and perhaps most importantly, liberals hate the wall because they know that its existence would shrink a valuable Democratic voting bloc. Millions of illegal immigrants vote for Democratic candidates. Whether it’s because they are forced to by local politicians or because they truly support the liberal platform, illegals vote en masse for Democrats. Since Democrats have come to rely on illegal support to win elections, they bend over backwards to grow the illegal population. They know that any plan to restrict illegal immigration would hurt their electoral chances, and thus they oppose the wall. As a result, liberals were quick to celebrate when the administration announced that it would delay plans to build a wall. They got so carried away with excitement that they even made fun of the president and his supporters for believing that such a project could be completed in the first place.Image result for Trump’s Border Wall Has One New Feature That Enrages Mexico Now, however, the joke is on them. As reported by Fox News: The agency in charge of U.S. border security plans to start building prototypes for President Trump’s proposed wall with Mexico later this summer. Ronald Vitiello, Customs and Border Protection’s acting deputy commissioner, said Tuesday that four to eight companies will get contracts for prototypes in San Diego that could be models for the roughly 2,000-mile border. Companies will have 30 days to complete the models. It looks like we will get our wall, and it looks like it will be better than anyone expected. Leave it to President Trump to take a construction project and make it even better. Most people expected the wall to consist of simple concrete slabs. Trump, on the other hand, wants only the best. That is why he is open to a more innovative wall, which contains solar panels and other fascinating high-tech features. Of course Mexico cannot be happy about this, watching their rich high-tech neighbor come up with solutions that will allow them to keep out illegals and make money back while they are at it. All while they still worry that Trump will penalize them on trade for the way they have hurt America’s economy all these years.Image result for Trump’s Border Wall Has One New Feature That Enrages Mexico Regardless of the wall’s exact nature, Americans should be ecstatic that a wall will end up being built. Our southern border has been wide open for far too long. Millions of individuals, including criminals, gang members, and terrorists, have entered the United States by simply passing over some bushes or a small wire fence. Once they arrive here, they sell drugs and commit other crimes. Even non-criminal illegal immigrants cause problems by taking jobs and receiving welfare benefits. This must come to an end if we ever want to fix our broken economy and culture.Fortunately, President Trump is committed to Making America Great Again. It looks like now we will finally get to “build that wall!”",1

He has never taken science as part of his graduate course and questions the legitimacy of climate change. Although he has a doctorate in public administration and taught business and public policy at Morningside College for ten years, he barely published any academic work. Clovis had made a reputation for himself as a conservative talk radio show in Iowa and an avid Trump supporter.When asked to comment on his credentials in a recent interview with KYXL Radio, Clovis, who is currently working as the senior White House advisor within the USDA, argued that he was “proud” he didn’t have any scientific credentials or education, because “scientists are nothing more than a bunch of mislead individuals anyway.” Asked to elaborate, he said that he was “glad” to be working in the Trump administration, but that he was, at the same time, “disappointed” as to where he was assigned. “While I can certainly appreciate President Trump’s reasons for placing me at my current position, at the same time I can’t help but feel as though my abilities are being severely misused here,” he said. “I do not agree with anything these people are trying to do. I mostly spend my days watching them run around in circles, trying to change the world or something. In reality, they’re just wasting their time.”“When I get back home from work – believe me – I thank God every single day that he had the mercy not to make me a scientist as well,” Clovis continued. “I’m proud I’m not one of them because they believe in things like evolution and the like. They have no fear from God, no understanding of things that they can’t see, taste, smell, touch or hear. If you ask me, that’s a pretty limited way for one to live their life. And you want to know what the irony is? They’re the ones who keep calling us traditional and conservative. They, who refuse to believe God made man because they found some sort of so-called evidence that man derived from monkeys or whatever. They’re so narrow-minded that they can’t except that we’re different and then they go around calling us the conservatives. It’s funny when you really think about it.”“That’s why I’m happy I’m not one of them. At the end of the day, scientists are nothing more than a bunch of dumb, regular people with limited vision who think dinosaurs actually existed and the earth is somehow getting warmer. They don’t even consider the fact that there’s more to us, to our species than just the physical and the tangible. It’s as funny as it is pitiful,” he said. When asked why he continues to work as president Trump’s pick for top scientist if that’s how he feels about it, he replied, “Well, just because you’re a member of the Trump administration doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay the bills. That used to work for members of the Obama administration, if I remember correctly. Not now,” Clovis concluded.",1

You, your wife and your children will all be receiving a stimulus bonus of $612 each to spend however you see fit inside the United States. The program, called “Tax Relief For Deserving Americans,” will give nothing to those who choose not to work, people in prison or illegal aliens. People on welfare in good standing with work programs or job training will receive an extra $25 in bonus food stamps instead. The White House Communication and Propaganda Office released a statement about the program and how it will impact the economy: While deciding how to distract the American people from the nonsense being “reported” by the fake news media about world events and interior politics, President Trump was reminded of hoiw much everyone enjoyed the money George W Bush handed out from the surplus left over from the Clinton administration. Mr. trump has decided people would rather focus ion spending some money than the nonsense on the “news,” and has therefore authorized the release of $612 each for every legal American from a working family. Democrats are already crying because the people who will receive their chunk of the $153 billion program don’t necessarily need the money that could be spent buying them votes from deadbeats who like free stuff. They also don’t understand how the program will be paid for. Trump had a simple answer: “It’s not that much money in the grand scheme. We’ll make Mexico pay for it with a new tax or maybe we’ll add a few bucks tariff to every case of Canadian Whiskey. Maybe the Chinese can help out. It’s be taxable income, so 28 percent of it will come back anyway. It’s not that big a deal. I’ve built things, great things, huge things worth far more.” One thing is for sure. You can forget about all the stupidity the liberals are trying to sell you about lies and Russians and North Korea and all the rest of the humdrum day to day you shouldn’t concern yourself with anyway. What a waste of time. Grab some cash and have some fun on your leader, Donald Trump! Checks will start arriving in the mail Friday.",1

Mossad says they lost 4 agents when everyone in the building suddenly just dropped dead, including Assange.” Our source can neither confirm nor deny that Assange was actually present, lest he loses his security clearance parking cars at Dulles on weekends. Out of respect, we’re not crediting this very disturbing photo of dead Assange to anyone in particular: The vultures were added later for effect. President Trump released this via fireside AM radio chat to 14 people who still have one of those: “Mossad and Interpol are now scrambling to find a double before the word gets out so please — be a good patriot and make sure everyone knows. Assange didn’t deserve to die like that. He was one of those good people his president praised for his hard work in exposing nothing criminal about Hillary Clinton but still. He did good things.

The only 3 nay votes came from the Trump faithful republican members who actually respect the constitution’s rule of law.  Newsom gave his reasons for passing the new law in a press conference earlier today : ”Texas Republicans, in true Republican form, passed a bill yesterday that would allow mostly Christian medical personnel, in emergency rooms or wherever, to let the LGBTQ community die on the floor if treating them opposes the conditions of their so-called faith. This proves once again how toxic Christianity is. It is a religion built on hate and indifference. Christians do not belong in our state. They do not fit in with our principles of love, family,  and community. So we will counter the Texas law with one that actually makes sense. In California hospitals and offices statewide, atheist – or anyone really – can now legally refuse treatment to Christians, regardless of their level of need. I don’t care if those monsters come in with multiple gunshot wounds, a heart attack, and a severed pecker. If a doctor is convinced of the patient’s faith in Christ, they can not only just let them die, they can remove them and let them die on the street like the animals they are.” Newsom went to say more garbage like “the state will be a better place without Christians” and “how funny would it be to watch them die?

The assault could begin as early as this weekend and is the most critical challenge yet to Isisâ€™s â€œcaliphateâ€ which had shredded state authority in the regionâ€™s heartland, led to a mass exodus of refugees, attempted a genocide of minorities and led to grave doubts over Iraqâ€™s viability. Iraqi forces, which have driven hundreds of miles for what Baghdad has hailed as a last battle against the terror group, moved into their final positions on Friday, joining Kurdish Peshmerga soldiers ahead of an expected advance from the south. Also on the ground are US, British and French special forces, who have been advising Peshmerga troops. They will play a prominent role in calling in airstrikes against Isis targets inside the city. Isis is thought to have around 6, 000 fighters ready to defend Mosul, hidden among an estimated civilian population of 600, 000, most of whom are expected to flee as the battle intensifies. The new wave of refugees is likely to be far more difficult to manage than the war itself, with authorities and aid agencies desperately trying to finalise plans ahead of the attack. Save the Children, one of numerous NGOs near Mosul, said some refugees had died on an arduous trip to a holding camp south of the city. Aram Shakaram, Save the Childrenâ€™s deputy director in Iraq, said: â€œChildren are arriving from Hawija on the verge of death. Food in the area is running out and they are hungry, thirsty and absolutely exhausted, having walked barefoot through mountains full of landmines and Isis patrols. â€œOur team heard of a woman and her nephew who collapsed and died just a few kilometres away from help. â€ Kurdish forces are expecting stiff resistance from the terror group, which has already lost the cities of Tikrit, Ramadi, Sinjar and Fallujah and a vast area of land close to Erbil. Despite more than a year of airstrikes, mortars continue to rain down on Kurdish forces. Isis is also believed to have placed thousands of improvised explosives in villages on the road to Mosul. The mines and improvised bombs are likely to make the going slow, and and war planners are expecting the campaign to last at least one month. Isis has also used mustard gas against Kurdish forces â€” up to 19 times in the past two years. The militants thought responsible for the groupâ€™s chemical weapons programme are believed to have all been captured, or killed, but a risk remains of further attacks. The UN estimates that as many as 700, 000 of Mosulâ€™s residents will be in desperate need as the attack gets under way. At least another 600, 000 residents and residents of the Nineveh plains are already receiving aid after fleeing the city after the Isis invasion.",0
"391","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/donald-trump-nigel-farage-us-election-brexit","Adam Gabbatt","Britain voted on Thursday to leave the European Union, after a campaign characterized by fear of immigration, anger over a perceived undemocratic bureaucracy and trust in a charismatic political outsider. If that sounds familiar, itâ€™s because it is. You canâ€™t fail to notice the parallels between Donald Trumpâ€™s vision of America and the desire of Nigel Farage, driver if not leader of the â€œLeaveâ€ campaign, to cleanse the UK of Poles, refugees and anyone else who canâ€™t trace their British roots back to the bronze age. The Brexit vote also revealed that the UK, like the US, is deeply divided. Sections of the voting population have drastically different opinions on the current state of their country and what its future should look like. Jowls and xenophobia aside, in appearance and lifestyle the two men do not have much in common. Donald Trump is a New Yorker who doesnâ€™t drink or smoke and has never had a cup of coffee. Nigel Farage is a cigarette smoker who grew up in the rolling countryside of southern England and has built a political career around drinking beer. In terms of background, however, the two have plenty in common. Blue collar they are not. Trump inherited his fatherâ€™s wildly successful housing business. Farage attended a school â€” only 7% of Britons do so â€” before earning millions as a stockbroker. Despite this, both have shown an uncanny ability to appeal to the working man â€” mostly by stoking fears about immigration. Trump thinks Mexico is sending rapists to the US. Farage hasnâ€™t been as clear about what he thinks the European Union is sending to the UK, but the fact he has been hawking a billboard showing a line of thousands of huddled, refugees offers a clue. Other Trump grievances include Washington bureaucrats making terrible deals, China wreaking havoc with the US economy and countries around the world laughing at America. For Farage, substitute Washington with Brussels and China with Brussels and countries around the world with Brussels. Every successfully intolerant campaign needs someone to demonise. The foreign worker who is coming over here and taking our jobs. The immigrant who is abusing the benefit system. The Black Lives Matter protester whoâ€™s just been punched in the face at one of your rallies. In America, the Mexican worker embodies everything the right perceives to be wrong with immigration policy. The Mexican worker has ruthlessly infiltrated the US with the specific intent of stealing poorly regulated and undesirable jobs. Oh, and of abusing government benefits. In the UK, this rallying figure is the Polish plumber, a man who has travelled from Warsaw to Wolverhampton with just one thing on his mind: fixing toilets. Toilets that a British plumber could be fixing. The Polish plumber also wants to abuse government benefits. In winning the Republican nomination, Trump beat out five current or former senators and nine current or former governors. In doing so, he defied opposition from the Republican National Committee and many serving congressmen and senators. In the UK, the Leave campaign triumphed in the face of opposition from the leaders of every major political party and the vast majority of members of parliament. On both sides of the Atlantic, this represented an epic flipping off of the established political class by millions of disillusioned voters. Which leads us to . .. Britain was hugely divided over Europe. Among to 73% wanted to stay in the EU. Only 40% of over 65s felt the same way. What was particularly startling were the positions leave voters were likely to have on an array of social issues. Opinion polls showed those keenest on protecting Britain from being overwhelmed by immigrants and fancy European ideas were overwhelmingly opposed to multiculturalism (81% thought it was a force for ill) feminism (74%) and the green movement (78%). In the US, older people and those without college degrees are voting for Trump â€” for policies that share much with such issues. The vast majority of the north of England voted to leave. The north is home to towns and cities that were built around industries that have long since left. Cotton, steel and mining used to provide jobs in places such as Preston, Sheffield and Sunderland. Now, there arenâ€™t many jobs. People are leaving, shops are closing, schools are underperforming, life expectancy is lower than in the rest of the country. Wages are lower. In Thursdayâ€™s vote, people in lower income brackets were far more likely to vote to leave. For the US, read: rust belt. In depressed areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia voters are more likely to flock to Trump and Republicans in general. Washington DC. Brussels. Both can seem distant, mythical places. Places where no one outside has a clue what goes on inside. Places power must be wrenched back from, where cats have to be put among the pigeons. Places that must be torn down and rebuilt. In the UK, the Leave campaign has achieved this. In the US, itâ€™s Trumpâ€™s turn to try.",0

The British progressive rock band Yes, American rockers Pearl Jam, metal band Steppenwolf, English electronic band Depeche Mode and funk singer Chaka Khan, were also included on the nominees list, which will be voted on by fans and music industry experts. Artists must have released their first recording at least 25 years ago to be eligible for nomination. The names of the 2017 inductees will be announced in December once voting is complete. Shakur was killed at age 25 in an unsolved 1996 shooting in Las Vegas. The rapper, who addressed social inequity and the struggles of African Americans, is regarded as one of the most influential voices in whose story has inspired documentaries, movies and a Broadway musical. Shakurâ€™s nomination reflects the growing acceptance of rap as a force in mainstream music and follows the Hall of Fame induction in 2016 of the California rappers NWA as only the fifth act ever to be voted in. Baez, 75, became a voice of protest in the tumultuous 1960s, becoming one of the first singers to promote the songs of Bob Dylan and singing at the 1969 Woodstock festival. Her performances of the traditional song We Shall Overcome in the early 1960s became an anthem of the civil rights movement. Jackson, 50, the youngest child of the Jackson singing family, is one of the pop singers in the world but is still waiting to be inducted after first becoming eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2007. Other artists nominated include Bad Brains, Chic, Electric Light Orchestra, J Geils Band, Janeâ€™s Addiction, Joe Tex, Journey, Kraftwerk, MC5, the Cars, and the Zombies. The inductees are chosen by fans and by an international body of some 800 artists, historians and members of the music industry who are asked to consider musical influence, innovation, and length and depth of career.",0

Homa Hoodfar, a landed in Montreal on Thursday morning. She had been detained with other Iranian swept up by hardliners in Iranâ€™s security service. â€œItâ€™s wonderful to be home and be reunited with family and friends again,â€ she said at a news conference at Pierre Elliott Trudeau airport. Hoodfar, 65, was questioned and barred from leaving Iran in March after going there to visit relatives following the death of her husband. Her family said she was held in Tehranâ€™s Evin prison since June. Hoodfar, whose academic work concentrated on development, culture and gender in the Middle East, until recently taught anthropology and sociology at Montrealâ€™s Concordia University. She was released and flown to the Arab Gulf nation of Oman on Monday before returning to Canada. She said the hardest thing was knowing her family would be worried and not being able to talk to them. She thanked those who helped secure her release, including the Canadian government and the sultan of Oman. â€œI didnâ€™t feel that I would be released until I was on the jet because in Iran nothing is complete until itâ€™s complete,â€ Hoodfar said. Hoodfar said the most wonderful part of her release was seeing her niece, Amanda Ghahremani, upon landing in Oman. â€œI just hugged her and felt free,â€ she said. In July, Iran announced indictments for Hoodfar and three others, without providing any details about the accusations. In recent weeks, Hoodfarâ€™s supporters described her health as deteriorating while she was in solitary confinement, saying she was â€œbarely able to walk or talkâ€. â€œI feel weak and frail but better,â€ she said. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau hailed her release in a statement this week, thanking Italy, Switzerland and Oman for their help. Canada has not had an embassy in Iran since 2012, when its government cut diplomatic ties over Tehranâ€™s contested nuclear program and other issues. Iran does not recognize dual nationalities, meaning those detained cannot receive consular assistance. In previous cases, dual nationals have faced secret charges in hearings in Iranâ€™s Revolutionary Court, which handles cases involving alleged attempts to overthrow the government. Several dual nationals have been arrested in the year. Analysts have suggested Iranian hardliners hope to use them as bargaining chips with the west.",0
"394","https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/nov/25/robert-rauschenberg-and-the-subversive-language-of-junk-tate","Olivia Laing","Towards the end of his relentlessly inventive life, Robert Rauschenberg confided an anxiety. He was worried that his mission to introduce the world to itself by way of the spectacular mirror of his art could fail, not because he lacked energy or talent, but because he might â€œrun out of worldâ€. No one had bolder ambitions than Rauschenberg, and no one did more to breach the walls between art and life, hauling the grubby, gleaming world into the hallowed chamber of the gallery and dragging art out to the furthest corners of the planet. A lanky Texan with a penchant for Jack Danielâ€™s, he was still finding ways to innovate in his ninth decade, despite being by a stroke. If his work can be summed up in a single word, it is combination: a prodigal wedding of disparate and unlikely objects and techniques. Best known for making the hybrid he called â€œcombinesâ€ out of litter gleaned from New Yorkâ€™s streets â€” lightbulbs, chairs, tires, umbrellas, street signs and cardboard boxes were recurring motifs â€” Rauschenberg was a technical pioneer in multiple disciplines, moving restlessly on as soon as he mastered a new form. â€œThe artist of American democracy,â€ Robert Hughes called him, â€œyearningly faithful to its clamour, its contradictions, its hope and its enormous demotic freedom. â€ Over the decades, he expanded the limits of painting, sculpture, printmaking, photography and dance. As a dizzying retrospective at Tate Modern makes clear, this â€œloosest, weirdest artistâ€ was a prolific visionary, whose gorgeous, sprawling work has lost not a single watt of its greedy incandescence. Milton Ernest Rauschenberg (Robert was a name he cooked up after musing all night in a coffee shop) was born on 22 October 1925 in Port Arthur, a oil refinery town on the Texas coast. His parents were fundamentalist Christians, and as a boy, Rauschenberg fantasised about becoming a preacher, an ambition he dismissed once he realised it would prevent him from dancing, an ecstatic lifeline for a dyslexic kid. His sensitive disposition brought him into repeated conflict with authority, starting with his father, a keen duck hunter disgusted by a son who refused to handle a gun (years later, on his deathbed, Rauschenberg senior confided balefully: â€œI never liked you, you son of a bitchâ€). After dropping out of pharmacy school for declining to dissect a frog, Rauschenberg was drafted into the navy in 1944, where he was made a neuropsychiatric technician in the Hospital Corps after once again asserting his refusal to kill. Throughout those years he drew perpetually, covering his bedroom furniture in scarlet and colouring portraits of fellow cadets with his own blood for lack of paint. But the notion that this might exceed a hobby didnâ€™t strike him until he was on furlough in California. He wandered into the Huntington Library and came upon two paintings he recognised from the backs of playing cards: Gainsboroughâ€™s Blue Boy and Thomas Lawrenceâ€™s Pinkie. Confronted by the swoony, enduring originals, he realised for the first time that artists existed, and that furthermore he could become one. After the war ended he went to art school on the GI Bill, sampling the AcadÃ©mie Julian in Paris, where he met his future wife Susan Weil. In 1949 they settled together at Black Mountain, the experimental, arts college in North Carolina. The head of painting was Josef Albers, a refugee from the Nazi closure of the Bauhaus. His rigorous approach to colour and composition made him the most significant teacher in Rauschenbergâ€™s life, though their native styles were anything but complementary. â€œAlbersâ€™s rule is to make order,â€ Rauschenberg observed. â€œAs for me, I consider myself successful when I do something that resembles the lack of order I sense. â€ Together with Weil, Rauschenberg began experimenting with photograms, where objects are placed directly on photosensitive blueprint paper, initiating a habit of collaborating with lovers that would persist to the end of his life. The couple married in 1950 and separated a year later, shortly after the birth of their son, Christopher. Back at Black Mountain he began a passionate affair with a fellow student, Cy Twombly, as well as developing a productive, sustaining friendship with another queer couple: the avant garde composer John Cage and the dancer Merce Cunningham. Rauschenberg described the encrusted Black Paintings and flat, shining White Paintings that arose from this tumultuous period to the gallerist Betty Parson as â€œalmost an emergencyâ€. It was hardly an overstatement. With the five panels of the White Paintings, he opened the door to minimalism, breaking away from the ruling cult of abstract expressionism and its macho insistence on emotional authenticity. By applying white house paint with a roller, Rauschenberg deliberately avoided incident or gesture. The works were pure surface: the first and most extreme manifestation of Rauschenbergâ€™s conception of art as a mirror for capturing the outside world. Look long enough, and youâ€™d start to see shadows and reflections an â€™t that inspired Cage to make 4â€™33â€™â€™ his famous composition that deploys silence to expose a symphony of random ambient sounds. Of all the groundbreaking years in Rauschenbergâ€™s life, 1953 was a doozy. That spring he settled in New York after returning from a European tour with Twombly. In his loft on Fulton Street he set about a series of paintings made of exalted and impoverished materials: dirt, grass seed that sprouted and died, mould, clay, lead and gold. He spent a painstaking month unmaking his notorious Erased de Kooning Drawing, a work of conceptual art before conceptual art had been conceived. He also began his voluptuously messy Red Paintings, chaotic collages assailed with a glorious repertoire of drips, splashes and smears. And on a street corner that autumn he met a young southern painter called Jasper Johns. Nicknamed â€œthe Southern Renaissanceâ€ by Cage, Johns and Rauschenberg were lovers, collaborators and a factory of two, egging each other on to ever more daring exploits. Dirt poor, they worked as window dressers, veiling this shamefully commercial activity with the pseudonym Matson Jones Custom Display. Speaking to Rauschenbergâ€™s biographer Calvin Tomkins decades later, Johns said: â€œWe were very close and considerate of one another, and for a number of years we were each otherâ€™s main audience. I was allowed to question what he did, and he could question what I did. â€ Neither had yet achieved much purchase on the outside world. Reviews and sales for the exhibition of Red Paintings in 1954 were as dismal as theyâ€™d been for Rauschenbergâ€™s previous shows. The only rave came from the poet and curator Frank Oâ€™Hara, who wrote presciently in Art News: â€œHe provides a means by which you, as well as he, can get â€˜inâ€™ the painting â€¦ For all the baroque exuberance of the show, quieter pieces evince a serious lyrical talent. â€ What does it mean to get in a painting, and what might you do once you get there? Would it be domestic or dangerous, erotic or dreamy? All these possibilities smear and slide in 1955â€™s sublime Bed, the best known of Rauschenbergâ€™s combines. In lieu of canvas, he requisitioned his own bedclothes, assaulting pillows, sheet and quilt with gory, libidinal gouts of paint and stripy toothpaste. A crime scene, one critic sneered, though the ecstatic nocturnal residue is also wickedly subversive: a closeted gay man airing filthy laundry in public . Making the combines, Rauschenberg felt he was cracking â€œthe secret language of junkâ€. They could be composed of anything: a goat corseted by a tire a stuffed bald eagle. One of the very first, Untitled (Man with White Shoes) contained â€” deep breath â€” fabric, newspaper, a photograph of Jasper Johns, a handwritten letter from Rauschenbergâ€™s son, a drawing by Twombly, glass, mirror, tin, cork, a pair of the artistâ€™s socks and painted leather shoes, dried grass and a taxidermied Plymouth Rock hen. All the same, thereâ€™s a limit to how much world you can cram into a sculpture, and as Rauschenbergâ€™s success grew he became increasingly fascinated by replication. Back in 1952, heâ€™d experimented with transfer drawing, and in 1958 he embarked on a grand project of illustrating Danteâ€™s Inferno using lighter fluid to transfer images on to paper. In 1962, Andy Warhol introduced him to a far more sophisticated technique: the wizardry of using photographic images on silkscreen canvases. Now he could reuse and resize his own photos and those he snipped from newspapers and magazines, giving him an unprecedented power of composition. Anything could be incorporated: John F Kennedy a water tower Bonnie and Clyde. As he gleefully observed of the silkscreen paintings: â€œItâ€™s as much like Christmas to me as using objects I pick up on the street. â€ He was giddy for them, until in 1964 he was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale. Terrified of stasis, the next day he called his New York studio and asked his assistant to burn all the screens. Focusing on any one aspect of Rauschenbergâ€™s life risks distorting the kaleidoscopic whole. Throughout the 1950s, he was as deeply involved in dance as art, designing sets, scores, lighting and costumes â€” headdresses like â€œinhabited seashellsâ€ a horse suit â€” for Paul Taylor and the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. An â€œawkward, but beautiful addition to my workâ€ he called it: a collaborative antidote to â€œthe privateness and loneliness of paintingâ€. The possibilities of bodies mingling on a stage excited him. His own forays into the form were characteristically surreal: in his 1963 piece Pelican with a kind of huge umbrella made of parachute silk lashed to his back abseiling from a skylight into a drum of water for 1964â€™s Elgin Tie. He was always pushing forward, willingly lowering himself into new elements. In 1966, he the astonishingly Experiments in Art and Technology, an organisation that sought to promote the use of technology by arranging collaborations between artists and engineers. The 1970s, by contrast, were less frenetic. Rauschenberg moved to the luscious Captiva Island in Florida, slowly establishing a substantial compound of studios and houses in the jungle. Inspired by a trip to India, the most beautiful work from those years involved a newly subtle use of fabric. In the enigmatic, haunting Hoarfrost series he used the old solvent technique to transfer ghost images from newspapers on to shrouds of chiffon and cotton. The Jammers were even more simple: bright lengths of silk, slung from rattan poles, like washing lines or prayer flags. The world gnawed at him. He wanted to get out into it to scoop it up. In 1982, a project at a paper mill in China his most ambitious work. The Rauschenberg Overseas Cultural Interchange (ROCI) was an attempt to engage artistically with countries he felt were culturally isolated. Announcing its launch at the United Nations in December 1984, he said: â€œI feel strong in my beliefs â€¦ that a contact through art contains potent peaceful powers and is the most way to share exotic and common information, seducing us into creative mutual understandings for the benefit of all. â€ Rauschenberg had initially hoped for public or corporate funding, but in the end he footed nearly all the $10m bill for ROCI himself, selling a Warhol and some of his own early work to fund an immense tour of 11 countries, including the US. Between 1985 and 1991, he visited Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, China, Tibet, Japan, Cuba, the USSR, Malaysia and Germany, working with local artists for weeks before hosting a substantial exhibition in each country. â€œAt once altruistic and modest and overbearing,â€ the critic Roberta Smith wrote of this unprecedented project, while the Soviet poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko described it as â€œone of the symbols of a spiritual perestroika of our societyâ€. No other artist could have done it no one else came close to Rauschenbergâ€™s stamina or appetite, his outsized faith. There was no question of running short of inspiration. For many artists the avalanching awards and wealth of later life come with an unwelcome diminishing of ideas, but Rauschenberg was still avid for discoveries in his 80s. Digital printing thrilled him, and he was making and exhibiting new work with the help of studio assistants even after 2002â€™s stroke (with his right hand paralysed, he simply learned to paint with his left). His 1997 retrospective was the largest ever American show. It far exceeded the capacity of the Guggenheim, spilling out into two other museums. A glut, you might call it, lifting the title of a late series a lavish extravagance. He was equally generous with what had become a substantial fortune, donating heavily to Aids research, education and environmental causes. When he died on 12 May 2008 of heart failure, the New York Times described him as an artist â€œwho time and again reshaped art in the 20th centuryâ€. In a wheelchair, heâ€™d still dreamed of photographing the entire world, inch by inch, asking friends to snap the most boring details they could find. Nothing was beneath his regard, and no one exceeded his vision for art as a kind of alternative planet, equally vast in scope and scale. â€œIâ€™m for yes,â€ he said firmly. â€œNo excludes. Iâ€™m for inclusion. â€ â€¢ Robert Rauschenberg is at Tate Modern, London SE1 from 1 December. Olivia Laing is the author of The Lonely City (Canongate). tate. org. uk",0
"395","https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/09/gravitational-waves-everything-you-need-to-know","Tim Radford","Ripples in spacetime, a bit like ripples on a pond, that propagate out at the speed of light. Throw something really big into the stillness of space â€” like two black holes colliding, or two pulsars merging â€” and gravitational waves created by the event should spread not just across the galaxy, but ultimately through all of spacetime. Yes. At a press conference on Thursday, physicists from the Laser Interferometer Observatory (LIGO) revealed that they had detected gravitational waves. Gravitational waves were predicted by Albert Einsteinâ€™s general theory of relativity, 100 years ago. Almost everything the theory predicted has been confirmed by observation or experiment, except gravitational waves. For a blissful few weeks in 2014, physicists working on the telescope in Antarctica were sure they had seen a sign of primordial gravitational waves left over from the big bang. Hope ebbed though as it became increasingly possible that they had instead seen an artefact created by dust in distant space after claims of a flawed analysis. Two physicists got a Nobel Prize in 1993 for studies of a binary pulsar which behaved in a way that could best be explained by Einsteinâ€™s prediction: gravity waves would drain away the orbital energy of the two massive bodies and these would then spiral ever closer. But that was seen as inference, not definitive evidence. Because scientists were convinced they had to be there â€” if their version of cosmic physics made any sense. If they exist, then two exquisitely accurately measured lengths at right angles would fleetingly change as a gravitational wave rippled past. On Thursday, that was shown to have happened. The hunt for them has been going on for decades. Fifty years ago Joseph Weber dangled metal bars in the hope of detecting telltale movement that could only be explained by a passing warp in spacetime. Nasa even sent a lunar surface gravimeter to the moon on Apollo 17 in 1972. In the 90s German and British scientists began work on GEO600 at Hanover in Germany the Italians have an experiment, as do the Japanese. Gravitational wave detection at LIGO which has an detector that uses a laser and mirrors began in 2002. But accuracy remains the problem: a wave from millions of light years away would distort a four kilometre laser beam by less than a thousandth of the diameter of the nucleus of an atom. Which is hard to spot. Physicists proposed LISA, the ultimate Laser Interferometer Space Antenna: a trio of satellites huge distances apart in orbit, keeping a laser eye on each other for evidence of gravity waves. Europe last year launched LISA Pathfinder, to see if the experiment was even possible with present technologies. Because gravity waves can answer questions about the moment of creation. Astronomers look back in time as well as space. To see something 13 billion light years away, they capture light that began its journey 13 billion years ago. But no matter how perfect the telescope, an optical astronomer could never peer into the first 400, 000 years of the universe, because it would have been so dense and murky that even light could not break free of the primeval soup. But gravity waves must have been there, right from the beginning. No. The questions multiply. Why is the visible universe made of matter, and not antimatter? And why is 96% of the universe invisible and undetectable, existing as dark matter, and even more mysterious dark energy? Why does it seem to be stable? Is this all there is, or are we one of a zillion universes? Why does it exist all? This ultimate confirmation of Einsteinâ€™s theory would be the end of one set of questions, but it would open up a whole new set of puzzles.",0

The first Benghazi is the city in Libya where in 2012 the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in an attack on a diplomatic station. The second is #Benghazi, a dumpster fire of conspiracy theories and nakedly political attacks, fanned by rightwing Twitter trolls and fed by the conviction that, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, thereâ€™s a coverup at work. The conclusive Benghazi report has finally been issued. It has no major revelations nor any further evidence of wrongdoing by Hillary Clinton, who has already taken â€œfull responsibilityâ€ for the tragedy â€” now get ready to hear a whole lot more about #Benghazi. A casual observer would be forgiven for thinking the report was already out there, as this is the eighth congressional panel to explore the attack, and in October Clinton sat for an grilling on the matter that yielded so little damning information it was widely seen as a joke, with committee Republicans artfully carrying out their role as the butt. But this report was different this report was put forth by the House Benghazi committee itself, the culmination of a $7m investigation, the upshot of which is that nobody not reached during the attack could have been saved, and further that the Obama administration talking points, while initially misinformed, were not intentionally misleading. It is, in short, the last word on Benghazi for sometime. But donâ€™t expect to stop reading about #Benghazi. Donald Trump will continue to peddle absurdities, such as the notion that Clinton somehow â€œsleptâ€ through the Benghazi attack. Fox News and others will continue to raise it. Outside groups will continue to file requests for information, and Twitter trolls from far and wide will do their worst. Never mind that weâ€™ve now had more investigations of Benghazi than every terror attack in recent history combined. Never mind that these investigations have now cost American taxpayers a minimum of $23m, or that thereâ€™s not a single select committee to investigate the tens of thousands of Americans killed by gun violence each year. The Benghazi committeeâ€™s tireless leader, Trey Gowdy, has already taken issue with what appears to be the overwhelming consensus that his report is a dud, insisting that new information in the report â€œshould fundamentally change the way you view what happened in Benghaziâ€. So far, so bad for Gowdy. The New York Times headline could hardly have read better for the Clinton camp if it were drafted by her campaign manager. And even the rightwing Drudge Report, which gave a banner headline to Clintonâ€™s uneventful testimony on Benghazi this fall, seems to have lost interest. At the time, the real smoking gun of the hearing from Matt Drudgeâ€™s perspective was a coughing fit and slow speech, which he claimed at the time was â€œobviousâ€ evidence she was â€” horror of horrors â€” taking meds. In all the years and tens of thousands of hours spent investigating the tragedy, the biggest upshot by far has been the revelation that Clinton used a private email server during her time as secretary of state â€” a security lapse that was both unwitting and not directly tied to Benghazi in any way. The second biggest upshot is likely the personal misfortune for Kevin McCarthy, who â€” as result of his comment suggesting the entire Benghazi investigation is a patently political attempt to tar Clinton â€” is not the House speaker. That is also likely a blessing for McCarthyâ€™s party. If we were going to hear the end of #Benghazi when all reasonable roads of inquiry had been taken, it would have happened long ago. Instead weâ€™ll stop hearing about it when Republicans stop trying to undermine Clinton and conspiracy theorists stop their theorizing â€” which is to say, when the sky falls down and the sea runs dry, or in a word: never.",0
"397","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/26/canada-first-nations-prince-william-kate-middleton-british-columbia","Ashifa Kassam","One of British Columbiaâ€™s most influential First Nations chiefs has turned down an invitation to participate in a reconciliation ceremony with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to Canada, describing the symbolic ceremony as a â€œpublic charadeâ€ that papers over the Canadian governmentâ€™s failure to keep its promises to indigenous peoples. The Black Rod ceremony is slated to take place on Monday evening, in a private sitting room at the stately Government House in Victoria. Officials have spent more than a year carefully crafting every moment of the ceremony, which will see Prince William add a carved silver ring to the Black Rod, a ceremonial staff created in 2012 to commemorate the Queenâ€™s diamond jubilee. The staff is currently adorned with three rings, representing the province, Canada and the link to the UK. Prince William is expected to add a fourth ring â€” engraved with eagle feathers and a canoe â€” that will symbolise First Nations in the province. â€œReconciliation has to be more than empty symbolic gestures,â€ said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs in explaining his decision to decline the royal invitation. He had been asked to hand the ring to Prince William and invite the royal to affix the ring on the Black Rod. Last week he and the chiefs of the 115 First Nations represented by his organisation decided it would not be appropriate to attend or participate in the event. â€œThe just didnâ€™t feel that it was appropriate to feed into that public illusion that everything is okay. â€ When the Liberals, led by Justin Trudeau, swept into government nearly a year ago, there was a sense of great hope within the indigenous community, Phillip said. Amid crushing levels of indigenous poverty, suicide rates and thousands of missing and murdered indigenous women, Trudeau had campaigned on a renewed relationship with Canadaâ€™s indigenous peoples. He vowed to repeal legislation that failed to respect aboriginal and treaty rights, committed to closing the wide gap in education funding for indigenous Canadians and pledged to address the lack of clean water and dilapidated, overcrowded housing that plagues many First Nations across Canada, among other promises. â€œYet that hasnâ€™t happened,â€ said Phillip. Instead, the Liberal government has repeatedly ignored a ruling by the Canadian human rights tribunal that found the government was racially discriminating against aboriginal youth by underfunding the welfare system. Its first budget â€” billed by the government as making â€œhistoric investmentsâ€ in indigenous communities â€” will not deliver the bulk of the funding until after 2019. â€œWeâ€™re sick and tired of the lofty, eloquent rhetoric on the part of Prime Minister Trudeau,â€ said Phillip. A similar situation has played out at the provincial level. â€œThe British Columbia government has proven to be absolutely adversarial to the rights and interests of First Nation people in the province,â€ said Phillip, pointing to the provinceâ€™s efforts to the Site C hydroelectric dam, a C$9bn (US $7bn) project that will see an area roughly equivalent to about 5, 000 rugby fields flooded in British Columbia. A campaign launched globally by Amnesty International last month calls on the federal and British Columbian governments to withdraw all permits and approvals for Site C, over concerns that the tramples on the rights of indigenous peoples in northeast British Columbia. Philip said the hypocrisy of taking part in a reconciliation ceremony was laid bare last week as the organisationâ€™s chiefs gathered for their annual general meeting. â€œThere were tears and accounts of the tragedies in our communities. At same time weâ€™re asked to participate in a reconciliation ceremony that for all intents and purposes would suggest there is a very harmonious and robust relationship between the First Nation people and provincial and federal governments,â€ he said. â€œAnd thatâ€™s an illusion. We decided that for us it wasnâ€™t appropriate to participate in such a public charade. â€ He wasnâ€™t sure if other aboriginal leaders would participate in the event and stressed that the decision was not meant to disrespect anyone. â€œI apologise for any inconvenience we may have caused with our decision. â€ The duke and duchess, along with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, arrived in Canada on Saturday. The family will travel British Columbia and the Yukon in a visit dotted with stops at First Nations communities and traditional ceremonies. The visit, said Kensington Palace, â€œwill help celebrate Canadaâ€™s First Nations community, its art and cultureâ€.",0

The host of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee criticized the former reality TV star for a set of tweets alleging that undocumented voters lost him the popular vote. â€œFor the record, massive voter fraud is a lie,â€ she said. â€œBut this lie didnâ€™t spring from Donaldâ€™s collapsing pumpkin of a head. Heâ€™s a marketer. His big lies are like his buildings: he doesnâ€™t build them, he just slaps his brand on them and tricks the press into promoting them for free. â€ She then examined where the seed of this claim came from, blaming â€œnoted Sandy Hook truther and moon landing denier Alex Jones, who despite protests got approval to build a bullshit pipeline straight into the presidentâ€™s brainâ€. She also said we needed to go back further and look at the Republican party in general. â€œIf Trump manages to smash Americaâ€™s institutions, it will only be because GOP termites have been gnawing away at the foundations for years with baseless claims of voter shenanigans,â€ she said. While Trump, and some of his staff, continue to claim that Hillary Clintonâ€™s win of the popular vote was the result of major discrepancies, Bee joked that he would have â€œwon even if you deduct all the ugly chicks, flag burners and Alec Baldwins who shouldnâ€™t even be allowed to voteâ€. She also spoke about Jill Steinâ€™s campaign to crowdfund a recount in key states, claiming people should be more invested in a key Louisiana vote on 10 December. â€œLiberals, I know you only gave her money because you thought sheâ€™d take off with it and never come back and we all want that,â€ she said. â€œBut instead of using your energy to undermine democracy, why not participate in it and help Foster Campbell win his Senate ? You could make a difference. â€",0
"399","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/02/empty-bottle-club-chicago-book","Melissa Locker","The Empty Bottle opened in 1992 in a â€œ barâ€ in Chicagoâ€™s Wicker Park neighborhood. A few months later, the venue moved two blocks up the street to the location it has remained in for 23 years hosting bands such as the White Stripes, Flaming Lips, Interpol, OK Go, Girl Talk, the Strokes and many more. It was also ground zero for Chicagoâ€™s music scene in the 90s with bands such as Tortoise, the Sea and Cake, Trans Am, Red Red Meat and Jesus Lizard gracing the clubâ€™s stage. On Friday, Chicago independent publisher Curbside Splendor will release a book, The Empty Bottle Chicago: 21+ Years of documenting the history of the club that helped a generation of Chicagoâ€™s indie scene make a name for themselves in the 1990s and then kept on going for the next generation. The Empty Bottleâ€™s owner, Bruce Finkelman, grew up in Columbia, Missouri, and arrived in Chicago with a dream and very few dollars. â€œI think we opened up the first Bottle for like $934,â€ he says. The club was in the perfect location as the rent was cheap and the fans and the musicians who played the shows all lived nearby, pushed into the then neighborhood of Wicker Park by the unseen hand of gentrification. (Real estate brokers may now call the neighborhood Ukrainian Village, but back then it was Wicker Park.) â€œA lot of us ended up there in the early 90s and it was a rough neighborhood, but it changes so fast itâ€™s crazy,â€ says Dan Bitney of Chicago band Tortoise. â€œBack then, it was really kind of the wild, wild west out there,â€ Finkelman adds. â€œI remember the second day we were open my manager had got held up by knifepoint. â€ The club was finally able to throw open its doors thanks to the scrappy attitude and hard work of the owners and the community. â€œI donâ€™t think we ever could have done it without the amazing amount of support from the people that were living in that area,â€ says Finkelman. â€œThey chipped in with painting, they chipped in the programming, they wanted to be part of the operations. â€ The club opened in their permanent location the night before Halloween 1993 and was christened with a show headlined by Ohio rockers Scrawl. â€œI remember we played a Halloween show and I dressed up like Carrie, covered in blood,â€ says singer Marcy Mays. â€œI had a pretty good costume! I just donâ€™t remember anything else about the show. â€ Before the Bottle opened Chicagoâ€™s scene was spread around the city, as locals hopped between bars such as Dreamers, Lounge Ax, the Metro, and the Rainbo Club. â€œThe Rainbo Club was the epicenter, even though it wasnâ€™t a venue. Liz Phair would be in there and the Urge Overkill guys and Jesus Lizard would show up,â€ Bitney says. â€œThe Bottle was really more the venue. â€ â€œWhen the Empty Bottle opened, it was this incredible moment because we didnâ€™t have to haul ourselves all the way to the north side to go to the iconic Lounge Ax,â€ says Kathryn Frazier, who launched her music publicity company Biz3 out of what she describes as â€œa closetâ€ in the club. â€œBruce kept it cheap enough that you would just go there to drink every night, and you would happen to catch all these cool bands. It created a big community and a culture grew out of that place, because we were just there every night. â€ â€œWhen they first opened, it wasnâ€™t the club that everyone went to,â€ says Sam Prekop of the Sea and Cake. â€œThere was a bit of animosity when they were first opened, but later it became like a hometown club, probably mainly due to its location. It was where most people lived. â€ Now when you ask Prekop how long he has been playing at the Bottle, he laughs: â€œHow long have they been open?â€ Besides the cheap drinks, the club quickly developed a reputation for putting on memorable shows. â€œThey booked the best stuff, and unlike a lot of bars, it was like that every night,â€ Frazier says. As the 1990s rolled on and labels such as Touch and Go, Bloodshot, Thrill Jockey and Drag City helped make Chicago bands staples of the college charts (â€œPeople think Chicago is like this magical place, where thereâ€™s something in the water,â€ says Bitney) the Bottle became the home to the burgeoning scene. â€œI remember the final night of a tour with Sea and Cake and Tortoise and it felt like a proper homecoming at the Bottle,â€ Prekop says. â€œIt was really good. â€ The venue wasnâ€™t just for local acts. â€œThere were so many bands that would come over from across the pond that would play their first show there, and then move on to stardom, but they would still stop back in there,â€ Finkelman recalls. As its foothold in the city became secure, the owners started to invest in the club, even improving its notoriously awful plumbing. â€œFor a while it smelled terrible, but they remedied that,â€ Prekop says. â€œIn the past you had to pick your spot carefully in the room and it would sound really great, but theyâ€™ve fixed that now, too. Now, it feels lived in and comfortable. â€ â€œIt had everything that a great bar should have â€” it wasnâ€™t very expensive to drink there, they had a couple of video games, and there were always cool people hanging out, hipsters and locals,â€ recalls Steve Drozd, whose band the Flaming Lips would drive up from Oklahoma to play. â€œIt was a great place. You could stumble in and Trans Am would be playing. â€ The club also was willing to take risks, booking bands and genres that were new for the indie rock world. â€œFor a while they were booking a lot of experimental stuff. These very exotic European improvisers. It was always exciting,â€ Prekop says. They would book freeform jazz, avant pop, and post punk, and helped bring drumâ€™nâ€™bass to the US. â€œBack in â€™94 when Tortoise really, really blew up, they were always flying to London, and they were the first people I knew that discovered jungle, which went on to be drumâ€™nâ€™bass. And they would bring it back to Chicago,â€ Frazier says. Members of Tortoise set up a weekly night at the Bottle called Deadly Dragon Sound System that became legendary. â€œThe place would be packed with reggae and drumâ€™nâ€™bass music,â€ Bitney says. â€œI have great memories of going there and dancing and watching bands getting super sweaty. â€ â€œIndie rock kids back then didnâ€™t go dancing,â€ Frazier says. â€œI feel like those guys, through their Sunday night at the Empty Bottle, really merged those worlds for the first time that I saw and they got a lot of attention because of that. There were cool things like that that Bruce would let people do. â€ In addition to his diverse lineup, Finkelman and his crew managed to create a club that bands liked to play and fans liked to visit, because the club was all about the music, not just the profits. One night the Flaming Lips were booked and Finkelman kept the room under capacity. â€œBruce did this beautiful thing which was he didnâ€™t oversell the room, he undersold it,â€ Frazier recalls. â€œI looked around at the room and asked him if a bunch of people didnâ€™t show up. He was like, â€˜nah, I didnâ€™t want the room to be gross, you know, I wanted this to be a special night. â€™â€ It worked, too. â€œThat show we played in 1994, that stands out as one of our favorite shows of all time,â€ adds Drozd, who felt as though Chicagan fans were early adopters of the Flaming Lips. â€œI played piano on this old crappy upright that they had there, and we played all these songs we donâ€™t normally play. It was a really magical night. â€ Of course that wasnâ€™t the only memorable show. There were noteworthy sets by the White Stripes, Guided by Voices, Elliott Smith, and newer acts like Vampire Weekend and Alt J. â€œI remember Jay Reatard playing there, and trying to steal the disco ball because I had charged him for it last time he had tried to rip it down, and we had bolted it up there so high that he just couldnâ€™t get it down,â€ remembers Finkelman. While the club has evolved, some things remain the same. Tortoise still packs the house, but on weekends Bitney now takes his daughter to the club, which hosts matinee shows. â€œThe neighborhood has changed,â€ he says. â€œBut thereâ€™s something about the Bottle. It was just consistent and thatâ€™s why it lasted so long. Everywhere else is gone now. â€ Finkelman, who has gone on to open other Chicago venues like Thalia Hall, and Longman and Eagle, knows how lucky he is to have made it in the fragile music business ecosystem. â€œI continually think Iâ€™m the luckiest person on the earth to be able to kind of walk through this life that I get to live in the different places that we have,â€ he says. â€œItâ€™s really been quite a wonderful, wonderful life. â€",0
"400","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/29/wisconsin-kansas-republican-voting-laws-unconstitutional",NA,"On a day that began with a major ruling against Republican voting laws in North Carolina, a federal judge in Wisconsin issued a sweeping ruling that declared a number of election laws in that state unconstitutional. There was also a ruling against Republican voting laws in Kansas, where a county judge ruled that the state must count potentially thousands of votes in state and local races from people who have registered without providing citizenship documents. Two Wisconsin liberal groups filed a lawsuit in May challenging laws including a requirement that voters show photo identification. US district judge James Peterson issued a ruling on Friday that upheld the voter ID law but struck down a number of statutes and policies that restricted voting. Peterson ordered the state to quickly issue credentials valid for voting to anyone trying to obtain a free photo ID for voting. He also struck down a restriction limiting municipalities to one location for absentee voting, time limits on absentee voting, an increase in residency requirements from 10 to 28 days, and a prohibition on using expired but otherwise qualifying student IDs to vote. In Kansas, the order from Shawnee County district judge Larry Hendricks came only four days before Tuesdayâ€™s primary election. Hendricks blocked an administrative rule from state secretary of state Kris Kobach. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed a lawsuit on behalf of three prospective voters earlier this month, a week after a state board allowed Kobach to impose the rule temporarily â€” through the November election â€” without a public hearing. It applies to people who register to vote at state motor vehicle offices without providing proof of their US citizenship as required by a 2013 state law. The affected voters were to receive provisional ballots to be reviewed later, and county election officials were directed to count only their votes for federal offices, not state and local ones. Ahead of the primary, about 17, 600 people registered at motor vehicle offices without providing citizenship papers, and the rule could apply to 50, 000 people in November. Kobachâ€™s action was a response to a federal judgeâ€™s ruling in May in another lawsuit that people who register at motor vehicle offices are entitled to vote in federal races even if they have not met the requirement. Kobach said he would not appeal Fridayâ€™s ruling because it was too late before the primary election. But he criticized the judgeâ€™s decision. â€œIt essentially knocks a huge loophole in that law,â€ he said, of its impact on the citizenship requirement. In North Carolina, a federal appeals court struck down voting laws it said were enacted with â€œdiscriminatory intentâ€ and targeted African Americans â€œwith almost surgical precisionâ€. Republican officials in the state government said the decision â€œby three partisan Democrats ignores legal precedent, ignores the fact that other federal courts have used North Carolinaâ€™s law as a model and ignores the fact that a majority of other states have similar protections in placeâ€. They added: â€œWe can only wonder if the intent is to reopen the door for voter fraud, potentially allowing fellow Democrat politicians like Hillary Clinton â€¦ to steal the election. â€",0
"401","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/16/us-aid-flows-in-to-cuba-to-preserve-ernest-hemingways-estate",NA,"The new era of normalization has brought hundreds of thousands of dollarsâ€™ worth of supplies into the country to build a conservation facility for Ernest Hemingway artefacts ranging from books and letters to fishing rods and African animal heads. Two shipping containers packed with tools and hardware â€” from electric fuse boxes to windows â€” were opened outside the novelistâ€™s Havana estate on Wednesday to allow work to begin. It was far from the most momentous event in the since presidents Barack Obama and Raul Castro declared detente but there was a symbolic charge to the unpacking of American goods that will be used to preserve the memories of a man who has become symbolic of friendly relations. Hemingway lived at the airy home known as the Finca Vigia in the 40s and 50s, and places where the Nobel literature laureate worked, fished and drank have become important Cuban cultural sites and draws for tourists from around the world. The home fell into disrepair during a half century of cold war relations between the US and Cuba, suffering under both a US trade embargo and the problems of an inefficient and unproductive centrally planned economy. â€œPreserving Hemingwayâ€™s legacy brings honor and dignity to North Americans and Cubans alike,â€ said Ada Rosa Alfonso, head of the Finca Vigia museum. The goods unpacked Wednesday will be used to complete the first stage of the conservation facility that should be finished in the spring of 2017, said Adams, director of the Finca Vigia Foundation, which raised nearly $900, 000 for the project. When Hemingway died in 1961, he left approximately 5, 000 photos, 10, 000 letters and hundreds, perhaps thousands of margin notes in the roughly 9, 000 books at the Finca Vigia. Most are stored in the decaying, basement of a guest house on the estate, but will be moved to the new facility as soon as possible, Adams said. â€œThis is where he kept the objects that he loved, and where they reside,â€ she said. Alfonso said the Finca Vigia could become a model for other historic preservation projects in Cuba, which has struggled to find the resources to protect centuries of globally renowned architecture and art. She said it was thrilling to see the containers unpacked after years of trying to preserve Hemingwayâ€™s home without supplies or equipment. â€œI really feel the fact of having the best materials, the tools, really having the best conditions to continue preserving the collection,â€ she said. â€œMaterial and tools coming from the United States isnâ€™t something you see every day. â€",0

His Movement for Socialism party approved his candidacy in a unanimous vote. Later, Morales said â€œif the people say letâ€™s go with Evo, then letâ€™s continue defeating the right and continue with our processâ€. Boliviaâ€™s first indigenous president was first elected in 2005, and then in 2009 and 2014. But he narrowly lost a referendum earlier this year on whether the constitution should be revised to allow him to run again in 2019. His current term expires on 22 January, 2020. Boliviaâ€™s constitution only allows two consecutive terms in office. He had sought to raise it to three straight terms. While this next election would be for his fourth, the constitutional tribunal has ruled his first term in office does not count since Morales did not complete the full term. This is because in 2009 the government changed the constitution to make Bolivia a plurinational state instead of a republic. The ruling party said it was considering four ways to allow Morales to run again, including the possibilities of changing the constitution through the legislative assembly or a drive. Other possibilities include having Morales step down six months early or asking the constitutional tribunal for another interpretation. But the opposition said any Morales bid would be unconstitutional because of the referendum. â€œNo means no,â€ said opposition leader Jorge Quiroga.",0
"403","https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-master","Jonathan Wilson","In one respect, of course, JosÃ© Mourinho is right. Modern football is for ever trying to read too much into too little. One bad week â€” three poor results â€” is nothing compared to his previous career. Manchester United supporters, perhaps, will welcome his belligerence in attacking the â€œfootball Einsteinsâ€ who have â€œtried to delete 16 years of my careerâ€. After a start to the season in which he has at times seemed slightly cowed, Mourinho has shown that there is fight left in him. Others will wonder, though, whether an edgy victory in the EFL Cup against a side is really the platform on which to be mounting such a ferocious defence of his position. What does that say about how hurt he has been by the criticism of the past week? What does it say about the selfâ€‘confidence that was once his trademark and one of his key attributes? The Einsteins line is intriguing. Even said sarcastically, it is a strange insult to choose. Five years ago when he was managing Real Madrid, Mourinho approvingly cited Einstein before the first leg of their Champions League against Barcelona. â€œOne day he [Einstein] said that the only mechanical force more powerful than steam, electricity and atomic energy is will,â€ Mourinho said. â€œThat Albert guy was not stupid. With will you can achieve things. â€ Was he, in this case, using Einstein as a synonym for â€œgeniusâ€? Or was it more specific than that? Is he following the more general trend of rejecting experts? Was he attacking some sort of distant boffin he imagines slaving in a lab to come up with theories to attack him? Sharp as John Giles and Christophe Dugarry may be as pundits, Einstein isnâ€™t the first word that comes to mind to describe them. It was the final line of the answer that perhaps gave the truest insight. â€œThe new football,â€ Mourinho said, â€œitâ€™s full of Einsteins. â€ The new football? Whatâ€™s that? When did it begin? Precisely what he meant is perhaps less significant than what the line implied. It was an acknowledgement of age, of the fact that there was an old football before that he, by implication, preferred, a time before Einsteins. He is not the swaggering young gunslinger radiating vigour and upsetting the established order any more. And that, really, is the problem with the reference to his career, as Mourinho must know. After all, nobody could really call ArsÃ¨ne Wenger â€œa specialist in failureâ€ if they took the entirety of his career into account. The jibe stung because of the clear in Wengerâ€™s results over the past decade. But Mourinho, too, has seen a decline itâ€™s not as obvious as Wengerâ€™s and he may offer circumstances in mitigation, but it is there. Between and Mourinho won seven league titles and two Champions Leagues in the six seasons since he has won two league titles and no Champions Leagues. It is not particularly surprising. Sir Alex Ferguson and Valeriy Lobanovskyi are obvious exceptions who skew the perception, but very few managers have success at the very highest level for more than a decade. It is a difficult, tiring job that requires constant and evolution. The will becomes diminished. It is far too early to suggest that Mourinho is finished at the top, but the doubts are growing. In a world in which pressing, at the top end of club football at least, has become the dominant mode, Mourinhoâ€™s preference for reactive football in big games is an outlier. It is too simple to say the game has moved on, but equally he can no longer be said to be at the cutting edge. That contributes to a general crisis of image and that impinges on his capacity to mould others to his will. Weâ€™ve got used to him. His attacks on rivals, directors, referees and the authorities once provoked shock now his every utterance is filtered through the recognition that he likes to play games. That is confusing because there have been times recently when he clearly has lost control of himself only for his outbursts of emotion to be treated as part of some strategy of manipulation. Either way, the impact of his public statements has been diminished Mourinho no longer commands the narrative as he once did. At the same time, a case can be made that he no longer commands players as he once did. Talk to those who played for him at Porto and itâ€™s like talking to members of a cult: they still regard him as a figure. His reigns at Chelsea and Real Madrid, though, ended in rancour and there have already been rumblings at United. His greatest results have come when leading outsiders, players with points to prove, galvanising them behind a cause. It is harder to do that, perhaps, when you are in charge of the richest club in the country. And harder to do that with modern players, who for Mourinho are arguably a bigger problem in new football than the Einsteins. Paul Pogba arrived at United and announced he wanted to win the Ballon dâ€™Or. It is one player and one interview but the focus on the individual prize did seem to exemplify a growing mentality. At some point become interchangeable, historic identities eroded behind a model founded on growing the brand across the globe, and when that is the case there is no reason for a talented player to care which helped him to his ultimate goal, particularly if that is the Ballon dâ€™Or rather than the Champions League. And if a player feels no great emotional commitment to a club, if he does not buy into their cause, for how long will he put up with the abrasive managerial style of a Mourinho? That, more than anything else, is what makes Mourinhoâ€™s public criticism of players â€” three times in his past six league matches, stretching back to his final game in charge of Chelsea â€” such a concern. Where once he was a master at drawing attention to himself, of deflecting blame away from players, he now seems regularly to offer their failings as an excuse, and that at a time when players have never been less willing to accept negativity. The world has changed and Mourinho has perhaps not changed with it. He remains, of course, a formidable coach. The situation at United is far from irredeemable, but Pep Guardiolaâ€™s instant impact at Manchester City only serves to highlight the growing questions about a coach who has always seemed damaged by what happened in Madrid, who perhaps has not quite adapted to the fact he is not the bright young iconoclast any more.",0

I donâ€™t know Steve Bannon, to tell you the truth, very well. â€ Kellyanne is Kellyanne Conway, the pollster who was promoted to campaign manager by Trump two weeks ago. Bannon is the driving force behind the rightwing Breitbart website who was named campaign â€œCEOâ€ in the same round of musical chairs. For a less chill national party chairman, the kind of headlines about Bannon that have surfaced in the last week could be a real bummer. Bannonâ€™s past includes domestic violence charges, allegations of antisemitism and a mysterious arrangement in which he was registered to vote at a home where he did not live. â€œIâ€™m going to get to know him,â€ Priebus told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, 72 days before the election.

"405","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/25/displaced-people-refugee-nigeria-starvation-death-un-boko-haram","Patrick Kingsley","More than 120, 000 people, most of them children, are at risk of starving to death next year in areas of Nigeria affected by the Boko Haram insurgency, the United Nations is warning. Intense fighting in parts of Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon has left more than 2 million people displaced, farmers unable to harvest their crops and aid groups unable to reach isolated communities. One small state in Nigeria has more displaced people than the entire refugee influx that arrived in Europe last year. A Guardian correspondent saw dozens of skeletal babies at a makeshift camp in the regional centre Maiduguri. Many had plastic nodules stuck to their skull, to allow the nurses to attach them to a drip. Many children are so thin their scalp is the only place where a visible vein can be found. And yet despite these appalling scenes, Maiduguri is among the best served places in a region the size of Belgium. Much of the area is still insecure because of the war with Boko Haram, and countless thousands have not made it to population centres where some degree of care is available. Orla Fagan, a spokesperson for UNâ€™s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said: â€œYouâ€™re looking at over 120, 000 deaths next year if you canâ€™t get aid to them â€” and theyâ€™re mostly children. If we canâ€™t reach people with food and nutritional assistance there will be deaths. â€ Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, said following a recent trip that the entire region was â€œteetering on the brinkâ€. â€œWe know in areas that we can get to that there are severe and acute malnutrition rates,â€ Watkins said. But beyond that, he said, â€œthere are pockets that are probably far worse than the areas that we are dealing with. And the estimates are that there are probably 400, 000 children who are in a condition of very severe malnutrition. â€ He said unless emergency measures were taken, 200 children would die every day over the next year. A crucial meeting is planned for Abuja next Friday (2 December) at which aid agencies will try to agree a plan of action. â€œAnd yet despite this background, this is a completely hidden emergency,â€ Watkins said. â€œThe international community hasnâ€™t responded on any scale at all. â€ Boko Haram, a jihadi group, has lost ground in the past year but its insurgency has left large areas of farmland inaccessible and many roads unnavigable by aid convoys. The situation has been compounded by a lack of international support: UN funding for the Nigerian crisis is 61% or $297m short of its target. Kashim Shettima, the governor of Borno, the Nigerian state that has borne the brunt of the insurgency, said the farming that usually sustains locals had collapsed. â€œMost of our communities have not been able to till their soils for the past four years,â€ Shettima told the Guardian. â€œItâ€™s just unimaginable 80% of the people [in Borno] were denied access to their farms by Boko Haram. â€ As a result, at least 55, 000 people in Nigeria are in a condition, Fagan says. According to UN classifications, these people are at the fifth and worst stage of food insecurity. A further 1. 8 million people are at the fourth phase, which is defined as a crisis, while 6. 1 million are at the third phase, which constitutes an emergency. UNOCHA expects both figures to rise to 2 million and 8. 3 million respectively within the next year. â€œItâ€™s the biggest crisis on the continent and itâ€™s being ignored,â€ said Fagan. â€œWhatâ€™s happening in Aleppo is horrendous, but itâ€™s equally bad in Nigeria â€” itâ€™s just a different context. â€ Widespread unemployment among displaced people has led to starvation even in places with access to aid. In Maiduguri, which has been overwhelmed by more than 600, 000 displaced people, the Guardian visited malnutrition clinics run by MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res. Most patients were the children of unemployed displaced people who had been unable to provide them with enough food. At a nearby camp for 3, 000 displaced people, its leader, Bulama Modusalim, said he had lost count of the number of residents who had died of starvation. â€œHunger is killing us,â€ he said, holding up a dangerously thin toddler. â€œPeople are dying of hunger every day. â€ The childâ€™s mother, Hauwa Nana, 35, said one of her five children had starved to death since they fled to Maiduguri and she feared her toddler would be next. â€œI can only feed them once a day,â€ she said. In Monguno, an isolated town accessible to journalists only by helicopter, aid groups said the situation was just as dire. â€œThe people here totally depend on aid,â€ said Mathieu Kinde, project manager for Alima, the first organisation to reach the town after it was freed from Boko Haram control. â€œThe host community canâ€™t farm their land because if they go, they sometimes get killed. â€ Officials and aid workers warn that if the situation continues it could foment extremism in the area and migration flows farther afield. â€œA hungry young man is easily susceptible to the manias of religious demagogues like [Boko Haram founder] Mohammed Yusuf and [leader of the insurgents] Abubakar Shekau,â€ said Shettima. The insurgency has created huge migration flows within Nigeria and Toby Lanzer, the UN assistant secretary general and regional humanitarian coordinator forthe Sahel, warned that many of displaced people may eventually try to reach Europe. â€œYouâ€™ve been totally focused on people arriving [in Europe] because of problems in Syria and Afghanistan,â€ he said. â€œBut over the course of the next five years, I can predict â€” and Iâ€™d be willing to bet a monthâ€™s salary â€” that the proportion of people who will arrive in Europe from Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and via Niger will grow substantially. â€",0
"406","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/22/uber-ghost-drivers-zombie-profile-pictures","Samuel Gibbs","China has a â€œghost driverâ€ problem, with Uber passengers being scammed out of rides and money, fearful of being picked up by what looks like a zombie. According to local reports, requests are being met by Uber drivers using profile shots to scare passengers into cancelling their rides, which means the driver is paid a small cancellation fee. When the passenger books the ride they are shown a profile photo, numberplate and other bits of information about the driver. Given fears over the safety of systems such as Uber, its understandable that when a profile of the driver pops up to confirm their pickup that many passengers simply cancel the request. Should the passenger carry on with the journey regardless of the deathly face staring at them on their phone, the ghost drivers will also claim that the passenger has entered the vehicle and cancel it a short time after, again charging the customer a small fee. According to a statement given to Chinese media, Uber is aware of the problem and is in the process of collecting evidence and user reports. The company said that it has a â€œ attitude to scamming behaviourâ€ and that it was refunding those scammed and was using technology to try to combat the scammers. It recently introduced technology in an attempt to reduce driver fraud in China, which confirms that the driverâ€™s face matches the one the company has on file. â€œWe have taken immediate actions and banned these reported individual fraud accounts while continuing to investigate and crack down on any fraudulent behavior to protect rider and driver interests,â€ an Uber spokesperson told Quartz. Uber and local rival Didi Chuxing merged at the start of August, leaving the new service with control of the new taxi industry in the country. The merger saw Uber hand over its branding, operations and data to Didi in exchange for a 20% stake of the company.",0

Max and Harvey Mills, who are 13, are to music by Shawn Mendes, the Canadian singer who got his break on the now doomed Vine video app (two albums later, Mendes, 18, is preparing for his second world tour). â€œBleedinâ€™ till I canâ€™t breathe, shaking, falling on to my knees. â€ The brothers mouth the words while Raja Virdi, a young videographer who has worked with Adele and Sam Smith, moves around them with his camera. The boys stand next to each other in the skate park under the Southbank Centre in London. They wear matching black skinny jeans, bought for them by their mother, Sara. Max, who strums his guitar, has an HM bomber jacket, black beanie (Max always wears hats, to set the twins apart) and his prized white Nike Air Force . â€œThese are probably the only things that are, like, show clothes,â€ he says of the trainers later. â€œI wouldnâ€™t normally wear them outside. â€ By 10am on this sunny morning during the holiday, Paulâ€™s phone is already running out of battery. â€œRight now, there are 11, 732 people watching this,â€ he says, reading the number in one corner of the screen. â€œThat will accumulate. â€ Comments left by fans move up the bottom of the screen almost too fast to read. â€œPlease follow me u are so good,â€ says marvelnick. â€œLove u,â€ says Antonia_bayramxox, who adds 28 heart emojis. I move in front of the camera and introduce myself to the invisible crowd to ask why they love Max and Harvey so much. The comments speed up. â€œThere music!â€ says Jxtie. â€œCuz theyâ€™re so cute and talented,â€ another fan says. â€œTheyâ€™re amazing in every way,â€ say Finnandolivia. Brookea_xx turns the tables: â€œMAX AND HARVEY PLZ ANSWER THIS QUESTION: will u ever be in Surrey? ?â€ Xtabbycatx stands nervously by the railings beside the Thames, watching the recording. Half an hour ago, the was having breakfast at a hotel a mile away. She was scrolling through Instagram, where Max and Harvey have almost 250, 000 followers, when she dropped her toast. â€œI saw their picture and they said they were here and I just freaked out and left breakfast and dragged Dad out,â€ says Tabitha Wilson, the girlâ€™s real name. She and her dad, Darren, 50, are visiting London from Stafford. She was hyperventilating as they crossed Blackfriars Bridge, Darren says. But why? â€œI watch them all the time, and they just make me happy,â€ his daughter explains. â€œTheyâ€™re funny and theyâ€™re really good singers and they just make me smile, and I wanted to see them. â€ The digital adoration is still draining Paulâ€™s battery. Next to the comments, emojis from fans bubble up from the bottom of the screen in a fizz of cakes, pumpkins and cherries. Another number keeps count of these â€œlikesâ€. When Paul ends the broadcast after 35 minutes, fans have deposited 1. 96m emojis. Almost 100, 000 people have tuned in at some point, a figure that would delight most TV channels at this time of day. Paul plans to do more later, â€œwhen America wakes upâ€. But first he needs to charge his phone. Max and Harvey are Britainâ€™s biggest Musers, the name given to the users of Musical. ly, an insanely popular social music app. Launched in Shanghai in 2014, it began to take off last year and has quietly hit the phones of more than 140m users. Thatâ€™s almost half the number of people who use Twitter, which took three years to build up a comparable following. At its simplest, Musical. ly is a music video maker combining features of Snapchat, Instagram and Vine. Its founder, Alex Zhu, came up with the idea after spotting teens on a train filming themselves listening to music on headphones. In the app, Musers choose from a library of more than a million songs, select a snippet, then to it exuberantly while filming themselves, typically in selfie mode. Increasingly, people perform comedy skits, dances or to film dialogue. Some, such as Max and Harvey, sing for real as well as . They can add filters and face adornments (selecting â€œswagâ€ adds a gold chain and a black cap). Musical. lys, as the looping clips are known, are then shared with followers. Live. ly, launched in June, a sister app, gives Musers the freedom to broadcast anything, for 20 minutes at a time on average. The twins lead a tribe of 2. 5m Musers in the UK, most of them aged 13 to 24. At the time of writing, their joint account has 2. 48m followers (they gain about 10, 000 new fans a day). They never drop off the top of the UK leaderboard, and routinely feature in the global top 10. In the US, home to half of all Musers, the biggest stars have more than 10m fans. Musical. ly, which has about 120 staff in Shanghai and Los Angeles, estimates that half of all American teenagers now have the app. Teen by teen, it is holding up a mirror to a new generation of digital natives, and changing the music industry. Musical. ly features videos it likes on the appâ€™s homepage the sudden exposure means Musers can get very big, very quickly. The appâ€™s biggest stars now have agents, merchandise and, in some cases, record deals. Itâ€™s why Max and Harvey, who signed up in March, are making a music video, with their own voices â€” they want to take their success to the next level. Todayâ€™s shoot, and a session in a recording studio yesterday, have been arranged by Cassie Petrey, who runs Crowdsurf, a digital marketing firm in Los Angeles, and Tim Byrne, the British former creative director at Syco Entertainment, Simon Cowellâ€™s label (Byrne now runs Fandom Management, also based in LA). When Petrey was 12 and at school in Kentucky, she made an online Backstreet Boys fanzine. Years later, while working for record labels in Nashville, she alerted executives to a new website called Myspace, and ran pages for artists. Now 30, but â€œstill a fangirl at heartâ€ she looks for talent on Musical. ly. She says the app is changing the game. â€œMax and Harvey did a Live. ly a couple of days ago, and there were, like, 50, 000 people watching it at once,â€ she says by phone (the boys were fooling around at Alton Towers). â€œIâ€™ve never seen figures like that on any platform. â€ Musical. ly also has a uniquely young audience, which partly explains the sense, outside the app, of a quiet rise to prominence. â€œI see kids commenting all the time that they canâ€™t follow talent on other platforms, because their parents only let them use Musical. ly,â€ Petrey says. Max and Harvey had about 150, 000 followers when Petrey spotted them. She says she knew immediately that they could be stars. Her job now is to work on their digital output beyond Musical. ly (they need no help there). They now have almost 10 social media profiles, including a YouTube channel (3. 9m views and counting). Engagement is the buzzword in this world, and Musical. ly succeeds by appearing to blur the line between idols and idolisers. Popular Musers are part of the community that sustains them, and a couple of featured clips can be all it takes for anyone to make it big. Really big. First came YouTube, where Justin Bieber put up his first video almost a decade ago, then Vine. â€œNow people are saying, â€˜I want to be a Muserâ€™ and we have the resources to make that happen,â€ says Tiffany Au, 28, director of communications at Collab, a â€œdigital talent network and entertainment studioâ€ in LA. The firm helps about 400 digital creators, including Ariel Martin, better known as Baby Ariel. She is from South Florida, has just turned 16 and is by some distance Musical. lyâ€™s biggest star with â€” letâ€™s just check the latest figure â€” 15m fans. She got the app a little over a year ago, after a friend showed it to her. In those early days, Musers were uploading static . â€œI was like, how do I make this interesting,â€ Baby Ariel says, â€œso I decided to use hand motions and thought, oh, this is actually pretty cool. â€ She has turned phone holding into an art form, and has been imitated by millions of Musers. In one recent clip, she to the Chainsmokersâ€™ hit Closer (it ambitiously rhymes â€œback seat of your Roverâ€ with â€œtattoo on your shoulderâ€). Turning her phone into a choreographic aid, she makes it move around her face in time with the music, like a hummingbird sizing up a flower. While she chews gum through an exaggerated smile, mouthing the words â€œso baby pull me closerâ€ she uses her free hand to draw the camera in. She says her clips can take between 20 and 90 minutes to create. Before long, Baby Ariel was getting recognised. â€œThis girl came up to me in Old Navy and I was like, â€˜No way, this is crazy. This is not a real thingâ€™. â€ She later left school to study online, so that she could devote more time to Musical. ly, alongside her mother Sharon. She is now a â€œsocial media influencerâ€ with aspirations to act. She speaks to me from LA between auditions at Disney and Nickelodeon. She is also in town to join Jacob Sartorius on his US tour. Sartorius, 14, has more than 12m fans, and now records original music. Sweatshirt, his first single (â€œGirl, you can wear my sweatshirt, â€™cause youâ€™re the only one I hold, And I donâ€™t want you to be coldâ€) made the iTunes top 10 and has more than 35m YouTube views. At the Troubadour club in Santa Monica, where, in 1970, Neil Diamond introduced Elton John to America, Baby Ariel DJâ€™d while Jacob Sartorius of Oklahoma performed Sweatshirt to a sellout crowd. Fans are desperate to meet star Musers â€” and each other. When Violet Summersby noticed this in comments, she arranged a in New York. A dozen or so big names mingled with about 300 fans. Fifteen free events followed in cities across the US. Now the and CEO of Muser Movement, Summersby hosted the first ticketed in LA in November. As well as encouraging engagement, she believes the app reflects a healthier relationship between young people and social media. â€œIt doesnâ€™t matter what you look like,â€ she says. â€œIf youâ€™re funny or youâ€™ve got something to say, you can put it out there. Social media is changing now. There was this idea that you had to look like Kim Kardashian to be famous. Thatâ€™s not the case any more. You can be whoever you want to be, and thatâ€™s now acceptable. Itâ€™s not acceptable to be something that youâ€™re not. People want to see your true self. â€ Itâ€™s a stirring vision, but it doesnâ€™t immediately square with the high proportion of telegenic, teens among Musical. lyâ€™s upper ranks, or with concerns about safety and privacy on the app. It is also clear that a significant proportion of Musers are younger than 13, the minimum age for app store downloads. There have been sporadic reports of attempted grooming via the app, and concerns about inappropriate lyrics and content at least two UK police forces have reportedly investigated complaints by parents. But Musical. ly encourages parents to monitor use of the app, and says it removes inappropriate content within 15 minutes it adds that concerned Musers or their parents should consider sacrificing potential fame and make their accounts private. All those I speak to, however, report seeing less nasty stuff, if any at all, on Musical. ly than elsewhere. Moreover, even if the top Musers resemble the glossy Mickey Mouse Club stars of yore, they believe that, for now at least, Musical. ly offers a freedom of expression and control that would have been alien to Britney Spears. â€œMusical. ly has allowed me to find who I am as a person,â€ Baby Ariel says. â€œBefore social media, I didnâ€™t know who I was or what I wanted to do. Now I do. â€ Where Musers find freedom and community, the music industry sees dollar signs. All the major labels make their tracks available on the app, which mobilises a bedroom battalion of promoters. In August, the label Republic reported a 23% increase in sales of Hailee Steinfeldâ€™s Starving after a promotion on Musical. ly. In the UK, Olly Murs of X Factor fame launched a #Challenge, another popular feature of the app, to promote a single on his new album 24 HRS. He to Grow Up while wearing face filters, including a teddy bearâ€™s nose. â€œCreate your own â€˜Grow Upâ€™ video you could win a signed copy of 24 HRS,â€ he wrote under his Musical. ly. Thousands of Musers have done so, adding the #GrowUpChallenge hashtag to their own clips and multiplying Mursâ€™ audience. At the time of writing, Max and Harvey have made the clip. The established stars courting Musers are at risk of being outshone. Baby Ariel now has almost 2m subscribers to her YouTube channel, roughly the same as Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Shawn Mendes, perhaps the biggest conventional singers going for the same demographic. â€œWe had an event at Disney, and all these Disney stars were there on the red carpet, but all the fans were around Baby Ariel,â€ says Alex Hofmann, Musical. lyâ€™s head of operations in North America. In October, Ariel made the cover of Billboard magazine. Thanks to Live. ly, the app, Musers are also cashing in. Those who stream footage through the app can receive special gift emojis that fans buy for cash as purchases. iTunes and Musical. ly get a cut the rest goes to the recipient, who may reward the gift with a BFF (best fan forever) award. According to the company, the top 10 Live. ly users have each made $46, 000 on average over a period. â€œPeople are quitting jobs to do it â€ Hofmann says. Back on the banks of the Thames, Max and Harvey have moved location to the London Eye. Another superfan turns up. Milly Fincher, 13, is shaking with excitement. She had been watching the skate park Live. ly at home and begged her dad, David, to bring her into London from Surbiton. During a break in filming, she meets her heroes and is speechless. They greet her like pros. â€œSo your nameâ€™s Milly, yeah?â€ Max says. She nods. â€œAwesome. How old are you?â€ She tells them. â€œAwesome. Would you like a picture?â€ They pose together. Milly posts the picture to her Instagram later: â€œSo this happened, and Iâ€™m gonna be in a newspaper with them!â€ she writes, adding five screaming emojis. â€œItâ€™s still crazy, for sure,â€ Max says while considering fame on the way to Wagamama for a lunch break (they wanted Nandoâ€™s, but itâ€™s a bit of a walk). â€œSix months ago, no one would have ever approached us unless they were asking for directions,â€ he adds, while Harvey plays PokÃ©mon Go, occasionally glancing up to check for obstacles. â€œNow, people are asking people for directions for where to find us. â€ Fame has started to change family life, even if the money hasnâ€™t â€” yet. The boysâ€™ PO box address receives about a dozen items a day, including chocolates, fan fiction and artwork. I ask them if Paul is secretly a pushy parent. He used to be a singer himself â€” musicals, mainly â€” and met Sara while performing on a cruise ship. He gave it up to support a family that also includes two younger children, and now works for a double glazing company. Max and Harvey laugh at the question. â€œHelp me!â€ Harvey mouths silently, pretending to be a hostage. â€œPart of me thinks Iâ€™d love to pause this now and come back to it when theyâ€™re 18, and had a bit more of a chance to grow,â€ Paul says. But the boys are way ahead. I ask where theyâ€™d like to be in five years, at 18. â€œWell, thatâ€™s probably when weâ€™d like to be touring globally,â€ Max says. Paul almost chokes on his noodles. â€œShush, Dad!â€ Max says. â€œYeah, then five years later, weâ€™ll run for president,â€ Harvey chips in. â€œYeah, then weâ€™ll build a massive wall,â€ his brother adds. Where would they build it? â€œErm, between me and my brother in our bedroom,â€ he says. Now all three Mills boys are laughing, before Virdi, the video guy, checks his watch. Itâ€™s time to go back outside and film the last shots.",0
"408","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/16/california-blue-cut-wildfire-san-bernardino-evacuation","Rory Carroll","An explosive wildfire fanned by a heatwave and strong winds has ripped through rural communities outside Los Angeles, unleashing fire tornadoes and triggering evacuation orders for more than 80, 000 people. The Blue Cut fire flared 60 miles east of Los Angeles on Tuesday and by Wednesday morning had grown to 46 sq miles, spreading at a speed and ferocity which triggered chaotic scenes as residents scrambled to flee. The flames consumed homes and businesses, including a McDonaldâ€™s and the Summit Inn, a famous roadside diner on historic Route 66. It was the latest casualty in what is turning out to be a wild fire season in California. More than 1, 300 firefighters backed by 10 air tankers and 15 helicopters dug trenches and sprayed water and retardant but authorities said the fire, named after a trail called Blue Cut where it began, was â€œ0% containedâ€. The smoke could be seen from Las Vegas and Huntington Beach. The National Weather Service warned that conditions would not improve, amid temperatures of up to 100F (37C) with gusty south to winds and humidity levels as low as 3%. Television footage captured a fire tornado, more accurately known as a fire whirl, a phenomenon in which flames and gusts combine to form whirling eddies. â€œIt hit hard, it hit fast, it hit with an intensity we havenâ€™t seen before,â€ Mike Wakoski, the firefighting incident commander, told a press conference. San Bernardino fire chief Mark Hartwig warned evacuees to prepare for bad news. â€œA lot of homes lost there will be a lot of families that come home to nothing. â€ Californiaâ€™s governor, Jerry Brown, declared a state of emergency in San Bernardino County. The Red Cross set up emergency shelters for evacuees, including several for animals. â€œThere is imminent threat to public safety, rail traffic and structures. Please follow the evacuation instructions, as this is a very quickly growing wildfire,â€ said the state incident information system. â€œAn estimated 34, 500 homes and 82, 640 people are being affected by the evacuation warnings. â€ Sheriffâ€™s deputies scrambled to enforce mandatory evacuation orders for rural communities in Baldy Mesa, Lytle Creek, Wrightwood, Old Cajon Road, Lone Pine Canyon, West Cajon Valley and Swarthout Canyon. Only about half of the 4, 500 residents of the threatened town of Wrightwood left, the Associated Press reported. â€œThis is not the time to mess around,â€ said Mark Peebles, a San Bernardino County fire department battalion chief. Wakoski, the incident commander, echoed the sentiment. â€œIf we ask you to leave, you have to leave. â€ James Quigg, a photographer with the Daily Press in Victorville, witnessed the fire explode from just 15 acres to cover miles of canyon and hillside. â€œI saw all sorts of areas where I figured, â€˜OK, the firefighters will use this as a line break, or theyâ€™ll use that as a fire break.â€™ And the fire just kept hopping over them,â€ he told KPCC. â€œAnd then it was like, whoa, this is going to be a problem. Iâ€™ve seen several fires in the past. I have never seen, you know, the flames burn so high and so close and right up to the freeway. â€ Another photographer showed people apparently running towards a burning property in an effort to retrieve possessions. Flames briefly trapped six firefighters who were defending homes in Swarthout Canyon. They found shelter but two suffered minor injuries, officials said. Strong gusts, terrain and southern Californiaâ€™s heat wave fuelled the flames. The fire shut down a section of Interstate 15, the main highway between southern California and Las Vegas, complicating evacuations. It was the latest blaze in what is proving to be an especially destructive, unpredictable fire season in western states. Recent fires have claimed hundreds of homes and killed eight people in California â€” an ominous record because fire season peaks in autumn with the arrival of hot Santa Ana winds. Itâ€™s part of a trend of drier winters, warmer springs and hotter summers. Climate change has extended the westâ€™s traditional fire season by 78 days since the 1970s, running from June to October. Fires start earlier and burn longer. The USâ€™s lower 48 states just experienced the hottest June on record, surpassing 1933 dust bowl records, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",0
"409","https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/04/five-health-myths-reinvestigated","Amy Fleming","The campaign has been running, in one form or another, in the UK since 1993. You may not know, however, that in this context, one portion equals 80g. What a nice, neat way, someone thought, of packaging the WHOâ€™s daily recommended dose of 400g. But while the tagline has been taken into the nationâ€™s bosom â€” with people often jokingly wondering whether a Terryâ€™s Chocolate Orange, or glass of Fanta, counts as one of their â€” obesity has continued to rise, and consumption has declined. The cost of fresh food has risen, and households eat the least fruit and veg. Food peddlers, meanwhile, cause mass confusion by flogging items in random portion sizes, and by only flagging up the eligibility of more expensive, or less healthy, processed foods rather than basic, cheaper fresh ingredients. As far as we know, though, the advice is actually sound. Some of the original hypotheses â€” about the extent of the cancer protection that fruit and veg offers â€” have been rubbished, but it is generally agreed that fruit and veg is nutritious, provides fibre, and takes up room on the plate that might otherwise accommodate a Mars bar. (That said, there is no magic superfood, and other unprocessed foods are good for us, too.) In 2014, a study by University College London suggested that seven portions a day were necessary, but, soon after, a much larger study found no evidence that more than five portions a day would give further protection against some cancers and heart disease. Phew. No one knows where this dictum originated. A 1945 US Food and Nutrition Board document once said that we need 2. 5 litres a day, but it also said that much of this can be obtained from food. In any case, how much we need fluctuates, on any given day, according to how active weâ€™re being, what weâ€™re eating, whether weâ€™re ill, and the weather. This is why our bodies handily tell us when we need more water (although old age can stymie thirst signals). Donâ€™t listen to anyone who tells you youâ€™re already dehydrated when you feel thirsty. Someone made that up. In 2011, Margaret McCartney, a GP, wrote to the BMJ to highlight the lack of evidence for hydration advice, including the NHSâ€™s more modest recommendation of six to eight glasses (or 1. .9 litres) a day. She namechecked an initiative called Hydration 4 Health, which promotes the benefits of drinking extra water to the public and to doctors. Hydration 4 Health recommends two litres for men and a little less for women (1. 6 litres). It is sponsored by the French company Danone, which owns Evian, Badoit and Volvic mineral waters. A review study published in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in 2008 found â€œno clear evidence of benefit from drinking increased amounts of waterâ€. The potential perks the study investigated included improved kidney function and detoxification, clearer skin, fewer headaches and reduced calorie consumption due to feeling fuller. However, the authors wrote, â€œalthough we wish we could demolish all of the urban myths found on the internet regarding the benefits of supplemental water ingestion, we concede there is also no clear evidence of lack of benefitâ€. Itâ€™s easy not to question this. Heat rises, after all. Roofs need insulation and so do heads. Except, now you mention it, so does any part of the body when it is cold. It is thought the confusion arose from the misinterpretation of an experiment carried out by the US military in the 1950s. It was freezing and only the participantsâ€™ heads were exposed to the elements, so, of course, that is where they shed the most heat. More recent investigations have found that the head loses as much body heat as any other exposed body part. Bad news for the hat industry. This goes back a long, long way: it appears in John Withalsâ€™ dictionary of 1574, and has been linked to a misreading of Chaucerian English in The Canterbury Tales. The original thinking was probably that fasting would cool the body during a fever, whereas eating would warm you up when you have a cold. However, in practice, we should feed both colds and fevers. Fevers speed up the metabolism and burn more calories, so food is welcome. That said, if you lose your appetite for a few days, bodies are adept at using fat stores for emergency energy. Drinking, however, is essential, and this is one occasion when you should force yourself to drink, even if you donâ€™t feel like it. Fevers and colds speed up dehydration (which will in turn cause mucus to harden, and this you really donâ€™t want to happen). Poppycock. Reading in dim light can be challenging, to the point of being deeply irritating. It can even give you a headache and result in tired or strained eyes. However, says the College of Optometrists, â€œreading in dim light or in the dark is highly unlikely to cause any permanent damage to your eyesâ€. Some studies have found that myopia is more common in highly educated cultures, in which children grow up doing more close work, such as reading, but the connection could simply be that richer populations have better access to diagnosis from eye specialists. Ideally, however, when reading after dark, light should shine directly on to the page, and not come from over your shoulder, thus causing glare.",0
"410","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/donald-trump-donation-pam-bondi-florida-attorney-general","Richard Luscombe","Trump circumvented Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules by routing the money through a charitable entity, the Donald J Trump Foundation, which is prohibited by law from making political donations. More controversially, however, Bondiâ€™s office was at the time mulling whether to join a New York state probe into allegations that customers who paid thousands of dollars to Trump University, Trumpâ€™s education company, for a real estate investment course were ripped off. Just days after Trumpâ€™s donation arrived, Bondi dropped her investigation into the alleged fraud, citing â€œinsufficient groundsâ€ to proceed. The story gained some traction in June when the Associated Press reported that Bondi had personally solicited the donation from Trump to a political group supporting her campaign. But last weekâ€™s Washington Post report that Trump had paid the IRS a $2, 500 penalty for the â€œimproperâ€ contribution sparked renewed scrutiny, quickly followed by a â€œ â€ disagreement this week over whether Trump and Bondi had ever actually discussed the affair. Not at all. The fact that Trumpâ€™s charity made the unlawful donation instead of Trump himself was â€œjust an honest mistakeâ€ according to Jeffrey McConney, senior of the Trump Organization. So, apparently, was the fact that the Trump Foundationâ€™s tax filing for that year did not record the donation to Bondiâ€™s group, but did claim that a $25, 000 gift was made to a charity in Kansas with a name, even though no such donation appears to have been made. In the words of the Washington Post, â€œthe prohibited gift was, in effect, replaced with an innocent sounding but donationâ€. Thatâ€™s nonsense, insists McConney, who said Trump immediately reimbursed his foundation and filed corrected paperwork with the IRS as soon as the â€œerrorsâ€ were brought to his attention in March by the Post and the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Despite flak from several Florida newspapers and the suggestion from the Miami Herald that she was â€œbought and paid forâ€ the stateâ€™s abrasive attorney general â€” who has publicly endorsed Trump for president â€” remains defiant. Having always insisted her office never formally investigated Trump University, and found no basis to do so, Bondi was forced on to the defensive on Tuesday after Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters about the controversy. â€œI will not be collateral damage in a presidential campaign, nor will I be a woman bullied by Hillary Clinton,â€ Bondi told Fox Business Network. Unlikely. Huffington Post disclosed late Tuesday that Trump subsequently allowed Bondi to use his sumptuous estate in Palm Beach for a $ fundraiser in March 2014, just months after she dropped the fraud probe. The new revelation raises further questions over whether Trump was thanking Bondi, and could weaken his own line of attack against Clinton over the sourcing of her own campaign donations.",0

The alert about Abu Waâ€™el Dhiab, originally from Syria, adds to a growing mystery about his whereabouts. Uruguayan authorities have insisted for weeks that he is visiting neighbouring Brazil and that as a refugee he is entitled to leave Uruguay, but the Brazilian government has said there is no record of Dhiab entering the country. Danilo Alves, a spokesman for Avianca Airlines in SÃ£o Paulo, told the Associated Press on Monday that the alert was issued internally to employees but declined to give any more details. The alert, published by the Argentine web news portal Infobae, says Dhiab may be using a fake passport. It also notes that Dhiab uses crutches to walk. Dhiab is one of six former GuantÃ¡namo detainees resettled in Uruguay in late 2014. Then president Jose Mujica invited them as a humanitarian gesture, but for several of the men, their time in Uruguay has been fraught with problems. They initially complained the government wasnâ€™t helping them enough and they also refused to get jobs, drawing criticism from Uruguayans. Dhiab, who has several health problems related to hunger strikes he undertook while held at the US militaryâ€™s GuantÃ¡namo base on Cuba, has been particularly vocal about his unhappiness in Uruguay. Several weeks ago, Uruguayan media began reporting that he had left the country. Government officials said he had travelled to Brazil and insisted he had a right to do so. They said he had not broken any law and was not being sought. However, last week the US Embassy in Uruguay said American authorities were â€œcollaboratingâ€ with Brazilian and Uruguayan authorities to locate Dhiab.",0

Fisher, 60, was aboard an flight from London to Los Angeles on Friday when she reportedly went into cardiac arrest. After the aircraft landed, Fisher, best known as Princess Leia in the Star Wars series, was rushed to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and placed in an intensive care unit. The hospital declined to comment on her condition on Saturday, citing patient confidentiality laws. There were no further updates from relatives who spent Christmas Eve at her bedside. Amid the uncertainty, shared their prayers and hopes for Fisherâ€™s recovery. â€œI am shocked and saddened to hear the news about my dear friend,â€ Fisherâ€™s Star Wars Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo opposite Fisher, said in a statement to the Associated Press. The actor added: â€œOur thoughts are with Carrie, her family and friends. â€ Others offered their hopes for the actorâ€™s recovery on Twitter using the trending hashtag #MayTheForceBeWithHer. included Fisherâ€™s Star Wars Peter Mayhew, who played Chewbacca, and Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker and said he and others were â€œsending all our loveâ€. Other Star Wars actors expressing sympathy for their hospitalized where Anthony Daniels, who played Dave Prowse, who acted as Darth Vader and Billy Dee Williams, who played Lando Calrissian. Fisher had been in London filming the third season of the British television comedy Catastrophe and to promote her latest book, The Princess Diarist. Fisher used he memoir, which recounts her experiences making the blockbuster, to reveal how she and Ford had a secret affair. It remains unclear precisely when and how Fisher became unwell on her flight to LA. A source who was not authorized to discuss the incident aboard United Airlines 935 told the Los Angeles Times the actress was â€œin a lot of distress on the flightâ€. About 15 minutes before it touched down the crew reported a passenger was â€œunresponsiveâ€. According to the LA police department, officers responded around 12. 15pm to an emergency call involving a female passenger in cardiac arrest. On arrival, they found paramedics performing CPR on the victim. In just a few, short conversations with reporters since Fisher was hospitalized, her family have played down much speculation surrounding her illness and stressed that their information is limited. Her brother, Todd Fisher, told Entertainment Tonight late on Friday that his sister was in intensive care and being â€œwell looked afterâ€. â€œIf everyone could just pray for her that would be good,â€ he said. â€œThe doctors are doing their thing and we donâ€™t want to bug them. We are waiting by patiently. â€Asked for details of her condition, he replied: â€œWe donâ€™t know. We hope for the best. We certainly do not know her condition, thatâ€™s why she is in the ICU. Iâ€™m sure everyone wants to speculate, but now is not the time for that. â€ There were no additional updates from Fisherâ€™s family members or close associates on Saturday â€” although she was believed to still be in hospital. The daughter of Debbie Reynolds and the late singer Eddie Fisher, Fisher shot to stardom when the original Star Wars was released in 1977. She revisited the role as the leader of a galactic rebellion in three sequels, including last yearâ€™s Star Wars: The Force Awakens. In her first and best known book, Postcards From the Edge, she wrote about her turbulent relationship with her mother, as well as a cocaine addiction and mental health problems for which she had received electroshock therapy. She also recently started writing an advice column for the Guardian.",0
"413","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/06/north-korea-kim-jong-sanctions-blacklist",NA,"The United States has placed North Korean leader Kim on its sanctions blacklist for the first time, saying he was directly responsible for a long list of serious human rights abuses. US officials said Kim and 10 other top officials also blacklisted were behind widespread abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture in the countryâ€™s system of prison camps for political detainees that has made North Korea â€œamong the worldâ€™s most repressive countriesâ€. They also were responsible for harsh censorship of media, academic and cultural activities, including imprisoning people accused of viewing foreign films. â€œUnder Kim North Korea continues to inflict intolerable cruelty and hardship on millions of its own people, including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture,â€ said Adam Szubin, acting treasury under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence. The Department of Treasury said that Kim, North Koreaâ€™s â€œSupreme Leaderâ€ was responsible for abuses in his roles as head of the countryâ€™s ministry of state security and ministry of peopleâ€™s security. According to officials in Washington, the ministry of state security holds 80, 000 to 120, 000 prisoners in political prison camps where torture, execution, sexual assault, starvation and slave labor are common. Meanwhile, the ministry of peopleâ€™s security overseen by Kim runs a network of police stations, detention centers and labor camps where suspects under interrogation â€œare systematically degraded, intimidated and torturedâ€ the United States said. Kim is â€œrather plainly ultimately responsible for the actions of his regime including its repressive policiesâ€ a senior US official said, speaking anonymously. But authorities in Washington for the first time identified other top officials directly involved in rights abuses, including Choe Pu Il, the minister of peopleâ€™s security, Ri Song Chol, a senior official in the minister of peopleâ€™s security, and Kang Song Nam, a bureau director with the ministry of state security. Another on the new sanctions list, Cho Yon Jun of the powerful organization and guidance department, is in charge of enforcing loyalty to Kim, including executing those who defy his will, the senior US official said. The sanctions were announced in parallel with the state departmentâ€™s release of a new report which documents the abuses throughout the North Korean security apparatus and political prison camp system. It is not the first time the US has placed a head of state on a sanctions list. Previously sanctioned leaders include Saddam Hussein of Iraq, Charles Taylor of Liberia, and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe. US officials said they do not expect immediate consequences from the sanctions, which freeze the assets of those named, and forbids Americans from doing business with them. But senior officials said that naming those directly involved could make them think twice about what they are doing. â€œWith these efforts, we aim to send a signal to all government officials who might be responsible for human rights abuses, including prison camp managers and guards, interrogators and defector chasers, with the goal of changing their behavior,â€ said state department spokesman John Kirby. The senior official said there was evidence that an increasing number of people inside North Korea, including inside Kimâ€™s regime, are conscious that Kimâ€™s strongman rule might have its limits. â€œWhat this report does is send a message to people within the North Korean regime, particularly at those lower to mid levels, that if you become involved in abuses like running concentration camps or hunting down defectors, we will know who you are and you will end up on a blacklist that leaves you at a significant disadvantage in the future. â€",0

And since the authorities made the decision to start removing them 18 months ago â€” cutting down an incredible one million padlocks in the process â€” it has been left with 65 tonnes of scrap metal to deal with. Now, authorities hope that the removed locks will be able to spread some more love, after plans were announced to sell 10 tonnes of the locks to members of the public keen to possess a piece of Parisian history â€” and give the proceeds to refugee groups. Bruno Julliard, first deputy mayor of Paris, said, â€œMembers of the public can buy five or 10 locks, or even clusters of them, all at an affordable price. â€œAll of the proceeds will be given to those who work in support and in solidarity of the refugees in Paris. â€ Juillard added that he hoped the sale, which is expected to take place next year, could raise up to â‚¬100, 000, with the remaining locks melted down and sold as scrap. American Lisa Anselmo, who launched a preservation campaign â€” No Love Locks â€” in January 2014, praised the â€œinteresting twistâ€ to the story: â€œParis has made a strong statement in this one act. I hope other cities around the world will follow its lead. â€",0

Somebodyâ€™s got to do something to knock the fear out of these negroes. â€ â€” Muhammad Ali, At the 145th National Rifle Association annual meetings and exhibits, you could see and purchase replica flintlock muskets like the kind Daniel Boone used, â€œwardrobeâ€ handguns the size of a cellphone, a 1883 Gatling gun, historic firearms from the Renaissance down through the latest Surge, jewelry, holsters, triple barrel shotguns, and camo everything â€” coolers, flasks, deer blinds, and lingerie. There was a motorcycle with a . machine gun mounted on the handlebar (sorry, not for sale) all manner of scopes, optics, and technologies â€œ â€ food products bulk ammo, precision ammo, ammo historical exhibits purveyors of cleaning fluids and swabs and corporate icons with slick, sales areas worthy of a luxury car showroom. And the flag, everywhere, all the time, the stars and stripes popping from pistol grips, knives, banners, shawls, bandannas, product brochures and shopping bags. American, America, sweet land that we love. A photo spread for a US gun manufacturer featured a whiskery, caucasian male standing in marsh with a dog by his side, shotgun slung across his back and a large US flag in one hand, the pole planted in the muck as if staking a claim. A country, a product, a lifestyle. That word shows up often in firearms ad copy, as in: â€œWe find peace in the solitude of this lifestyle, and we thrive on all the great outdoors has to offer. â€ But on this rainy opening day of the NRA convention all the action was indoors. â€œEleven Acres of Guns Gearâ€ promised the banner in front of the Kentucky exposition center, a thuddingly nondescript series of enormous beige boxes that inhaled thousands of conventioneers without so much as a belch. How big is 11 acres? Felt like a hundred, which isnâ€™t to say that this conventioneer was the least bit bored. Mingling with a crowd striking for its nearly uniform whiteness, I did lapse into a kind of fugue state from time to time, a retail trance brought on by sheer sensory overload, but with all this American ingenuity and weirdness on display, actual boredom was out of the question. Old people and those less old but morbidly obese trundled about on motorized scooters, their baskets filled to the brim with corporate swag. The crowd buzz was punctuated by omnipresent promotional videos, impromptu live briefings on subjects such as â€œtarget acquisitionâ€ skills, and music, mostly country or though I did pass a booth where Lido Shuffle was playing. A guy dressed like Zorro wandered past, then a guy dressed up as a frontier sheriff, with a badge on his vest and on his hips. Eddie Eagle was here, the NRAâ€™s and mascot, a flightless bipedal cousin of Big Bird. Glossy signage pushed a steady visual diet of Americana â€” cowboys and pioneers, war heroes, the family, founding fathers, rugged outdoors individualism, our freedoms and the defense of same, all embodied by photogenic white people, not a brown or black face to be seen. Celebrities signed posters and flacked merchandise, among them stars of hunting shows, Nascar drivers, pro wrestlers, decorated veterans. More flags. History. Freedoms. America and her guns, cultural icons embedded in the brain like saints in the windows of a church: Colt, Remington, Winchester, Smith Wesson, brands curated with all the pomp and solemnity of holy relics. What gun culture lacks in wit â€” for grownup delinquent fun and subversion, you canâ€™t beat a rally â€” it more than makes up for in design wizardry, precision tooling and a long and honorable tradition of craftsmanship. But somethingâ€™s happened in the past several decades, a kind of fetishizing where categories divide, then subdivide into ever narrower specialties that seem to have little to do with utility. How many variations on the â€œplatformâ€ â€” the civilian version of the M16 assault rifle â€” can there be? The was used in the San Bernardino and Sandy Hook elementary school mass shootings, and again more recently in Orlando, with 49 dead and 53 wounded. Itâ€™s also featured in a 20 January 2016 post on the NRAâ€™s website titled â€œWhy the is Americaâ€™s Most Popular Rifleâ€. â€œThe [sic] ability to be modified to your own personal taste is one of the things that makes it so unique,â€ reads the post, and indeed, walking the floor of the exhibition hall I ended up at all the polymers, alloys, finishes, calibers, stock and barrel configurations, buffer systems, trigger systems, muzzle brakes and so on, to infinity and beyond. I had entered the realms of style that is to say, the dark swamps of consumer psychology where desire, identity and aspiration are always bubbling in a subterranean psychic stew. What kind of AR man do you want to be? Or woman, for that matter â€” take yours in solid pink or â€œMuddy Girlâ€ camo? Most of our buying these days has less to do with need than with serving fantasies and tamping down fears. Clothes do it for us. Vehicles too, profoundly in my neighborhood in Dallas you see plenty of spiff pickup trucks â€œhauling airâ€ as the saying goes, driven by men with soft hands and closets full of suits. But in our terrorized, polarized, ferociously tribalized times itâ€™s hard to think of a more charged consumer item, one as psychologically fraught, as a gun. For relatively not much money we can buy ourselves a piece of that rugged individualism and triumphant history (â€œFor nostalgic hunting or cowboy type shooting the 1886 Classic Carbine or Standard Rifle are perfectâ€) and raise a big middle finger to Isis, the feds, the gays, feminists, whoever it is we think is messing with us. A gun keeps us in character, the American character, as helpfully illustrated by all those fancy marketing visuals, which might as well be movie stills from the reel of greatest hits playing in every Americanâ€™s mind. With a centuryâ€™s worth of Hollywood puffing your product, not to mention the explicit blessing of the US constitution, gun marketing has to be one of the gigs around. What other consumer item is sanctioned by the Bill of Rights? And by God according to the NRA this market shall not be infringed or treaded upon or trimmed in any way, even if a literal reading of the second amendment happens to turn up the words â€œwell regulatedâ€. Maybe that inconvenient phrase explains why one searches the NRAâ€™s extensive website in vain for the actual text of the second amendment. At the exposition center I kept seeing the word â€œtacticalâ€ â€” tactical gear, tactical clothes, tactical categories of guns. What did it mean? â€œTacticalâ€ as opposed to, uh, strategic? Then I watched a fantastically violent, video of a â€œtacticalâ€ shotgun in action. A guy in a gilly suit â€” he looked like a Chewbacca â€” blasted his way through a series of targets that included watermelons, glass globes filled with red liquid, and fully clothed anthropomorphic mannequins, bam bam bam, stuff exploding faster than you can snap your fingers. Thatâ€™s when I got it, or at least I think I did. This wasnâ€™t a hunting firearm. â€œTacticalâ€ denotes human. The encounter. â€œItâ€™s just not the way it was,â€ Donald Trump said later that day to thousands of NRA faithful gathered in Freedom Hall. â€œItâ€™s just not the way it was, and weâ€™re gonna bring it back, and weâ€™re gonna bring it back to a real place to where we donâ€™t have to be so frightened, we donâ€™t have to be so afraid. â€ At that instant I seemed to feel a kink in the air, a sudden gash in the continuum, which was possibly the â€œgckh!â€ of hundreds of sales reps choking on their Cheetos. â€œNot . .. be . .. frightened? What the hell! Who does Trump think weâ€™re supposed to sell all these guns to?â€ Those sales reps neednâ€™t worry. Fear is the herpes of American politics: the symptoms may bloom and fade according to stress levels or the phases of the moon, but the virus never dies. That the world is full of dangers is beyond dispute. Peril is the air we humans have always breathed, a fact of life that demands of us open eyes, a clear head and emotional . Otherwise weâ€™re doomed to the existential level of mice, or, as one authoritative text put it long ago: The sound of a driven leaf shall put them to flight, and they shall flee as one flees from the sword, and they shall fall when none pursues. They shall stumble over one another, as if to escape a sword, though none pursues and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies, Leviticus 26: Your true enemies, as opposed to the imagined, the inflated, the convenient. In his classic 1964 essay â€œThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsâ€ Richard Hofstadter did the nation a great service by analyzing our tendency toward phobia and panic, but I was thinking of another writer when I arrived in Louisville, a native son of the city, lifelong member of the NRA, and author of such classics as Hellâ€™s Angels and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Hunter Stockton Thompson ( ) was the wild child of an insurance salesman father and librarian mother, his formative years marked by mischief and petty crime that progressed, by the time of his senior year of high school, to stealing cars and robbing liquor stores. â€œI was cursed with a dark sense of humor,â€ he later wrote, perhaps too modestly, â€œthat made many adults afraid of me, for reasons they couldnâ€™t quite put their fingers on. â€ These days the young Hunter would likely earn himself a diagnosis of ADD, along with IQ scores well in the genius range. Add to these a taste for risk, an acute and easily offended sense of justice, and a congenital contempt for authority, and what you have is a prime example of a distinctly American strain of wildness, the same strain that drove Huck Finn to light out for the territory, and Diane Arbus into the precincts of the damned and deformed. â€œThere is no human being within 500 miles to whom I can communicate anything â€” much less the fear and loathing that is on me after todayâ€™s murder,â€ Thompson wrote to a friend on the day of John F Kennedyâ€™s assassination. Thus the franchise was born, out of a cold rage that would develop over time into a tool for analyzing not just the writerâ€™s own soul and psyche, but that of the country as well. Years later he elaborated in an interview: People accused me of stealing â€˜fear and loathingâ€™ [from SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard] â€” fuck no, that came straight out of what I felt. If I had seen it, I probably would have stolen it. Yeah, I just remember thinking about Kennedy, that this is so bad I need new words for it. And â€˜fear and loathingâ€™ â€” yeah, it defines a certain state, an attitude, It was a state and attitude that any number of phenomena could provoke in him â€” Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, the marketing of Z28 Camaros or the death of the American dream. Fear, for the damage this horror might do to body and soul loathing, for its affront to justice, mercy, love and the spirit of fun. For Thompson, fun included enthusiastic and knowledgeable gun ownership. Lots of boys like things that go boom, and some never stop liking them. Thompson, who once gave a firecracker bomb to David Letterman on the air, was one of those boys, his passion going hand in glove with his famous appetite for drugs, alcohol and other adult activities, including politics and the Book of Revelation. At times his own prophecies show biblical vision, as in this piece titled â€œSeptember 11, 2001â€ (dated the day after) from his book Kingdom of Fear: The towers are gone now, reduced to bloody rubble along with all hopes for Peace in Our Time, in the United States or any other country. Make no mistake about it: We are At War now â€” with somebody â€” and we will stay At War with that mysterious Enemy for the rest of our lives. It will be a Religious War, a sort of Christian Jihad, fueled by religious hatred and led by merciless fanatics on both sides. It will be guerilla warfare on a global scale, with no front lines and no identifiable enemy . .. This is going to be a very expensive war, and Victory is not guaranteed. The synchronicity seemed perfect. I would go to Louisville and hang out with the NRA, and in my downtime seek out traces of Americaâ€™s prose laureate of fear, loathing and firearms. One morning a retired reporter drove me around Thompsonâ€™s old Cherokee Park neighborhood, a pleasant area of rolling hills, comfortable houses and generous urban parks. Thompsonâ€™s extremely awesome fetched me from my motel and drove me to meet one of his childhood friends, an southern gentleman who observed that for all his alleged madness, Thompson was scrupulously careful with guns. Check out the photos, he told me. In nearly every photo of Thompson with guns â€” and there are many â€” the gun is â€œsafeâ€ when not in actual use, ie bolt actions with the bolt open, shotguns broken, revolvers with the cylinders out. â€œA lot of people shouldnâ€™t own guns,â€ Thompson said once. â€œI should. I have a safety record. â€ Iâ€™d come to Louisville for guns, but around town I began seeing banners for something called the Festival of Faiths, this yearâ€™s edition billed as â€œPathways to Nonviolenceâ€. Synchronicity + Serendipity = Karma, or at least a trail that seemed worth following. Friends of friends led to cocktails with some amiable Louisvillians, which led to dinner, which led to a festival concert presided over by Teddy Abrams, the wunderkind conductor of the Louisville Orchestra, which ended with all of the eveningâ€™s performers â€” Abrams, a Pakistani rock group, a salsa band, an angelic South African vocalist, and Ricky Skaggs and his bluegrass band â€” jamming like a musical UN while dozens of people who evidently donâ€™t dance very much (I was one) happily danced below the stage. America is various. It refuses to be all one thing or all the other. The next day I was back at the festival to hear a panel discussion, â€œFace to Face with Islamophobiaâ€ moderated by Tori Murden McClure, MDiv (Harvard) president of Spalding University, and the first woman to row solo across the Atlantic Ocean (America is various! ). She began with a series of thoughtful, measured remarks about Islam, the global war on terror, and the abiding fact of the US complex. She discussed â€œterrorism in contextâ€ and offered numerical markers such as these: US deaths from terrorism, (all numbers estimated and rounded up): And this: US deaths in incidents involving firearms, : 404, 496, And also this: Estimated civilian deaths from GWOT in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, (from neutral sources, estimate): 1, 170, 000, Another Islamophobia speaker, Dr Ingrid Mattson, former president of the Islamic Society of North America, talked about the â€œgreat closing of the American mindâ€ since and its emotional corollary, as performed by people in airports freaking out at the sight of her headscarf. Whatâ€™s with all these Christians walking around scared out of their skins? â€œFollow the money,â€ she advised. Track it through to the books, the thinktanks, the Pacs and TV pundits. can be a great career move for a pol or talking head. Itâ€™s exciting. It draws attention. It moves product. â€œThis country depends on war as a primary industry,â€ Hunter Thompson said in a 2003 interview, but he might have just as easily said â€œfearâ€ as â€œwarâ€. Later in the same interview he commented: This country has been having a nationwide nervous breakdown since . A nation of people suddenly broke, the market economy goes to shit, and theyâ€™re threatened on every side by an unknown, sinister enemy. But I donâ€™t think fear is a very effective way of dealing with things â€” of responding to reality. Fear is just another word for ignorance, So with all this banging around in my head, I walked into the Kentucky exposition center the next morning and confronted those 11 acres of guns. I had definitely found the money, but so what? This is America and this is what Americans do, we make money. I wandered around arguing with myself in this vein for a while, then decided that what was confusing me was the presumption, for lack of a better word. The mashup of lethality and sleek retail culture, a Mall of Death sort of upbeat perkiness, with thick dollops of belligerence and bravado. â€œOur Brass Jacket Hollow Point rounds deliver massive expansion and deep penetration for ultimate stopping power. â€ â€œShoulder Bones Are Mere Speed Bumps. â€ â€œOptimal penetration and expansion through even heavy clothing. â€ â€œ confidence. â€ â€œCutting petals. â€ â€œDeadly downrange stopping power. â€ â€œExpands rapidly to 2X the diameter to carve massive wound channels. â€ This kind of verbiage makes perfect sense, once you accept the basic premise. Guns are machines for inflicting deadly force â€” whatâ€™s the point of the damn thing if it shoots marshmallows? Itâ€™s not hard to envision a scenario where you would want a firearm where you would feel very much a fool for not having one. The world is indeed a dangerous place. Lots of disturbed people out there, damaged people, fanatics, shitbirds, mean people with all the conscience of a starved rat. But hereâ€™s the rub: weâ€™re much more likely to shoot our families, our lovers, ourselves than we are that marauding stranger. The numbers bear this out: you bring a gun into your house, the chances of you or a family member being killed by a gun are far greater than the chance youâ€™ll ever use it for . Which could be viewed as statistical proof â€” as if it was needed â€” that human beings are flawed. Weâ€™re creatures of passion, impulse, pride, mood and pitifully fragile ego, with barely the patience to drive a mile in our cars without wanting to kill someone. Womenâ€™s mortality rises especially high when guns are around. I thought about all this as I sat in Freedom Hall and listened to Wayne LaPierre, the NRAâ€™s longtime CEO, deliver a phrase so familiar to the membership that they recited it with him: The surest way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun. Sometimes it really is that pure, but human nature being what it is, we contain sufficient good and evil in ourselves that many of us can recall a crisis in our lives and be grateful that there wasnâ€™t a gun nearby. Or remember with regret that there was. Just as I can imagine scenarios where Iâ€™d feel foolish and reckless for not having a gun, I can conceive of just as many situations where Iâ€™d be the worldâ€™s biggest fool for having one. But in NRA Land the lines are always bright and clear: us against them, good versus bad, American versus villains. â€œWe, in this room, we are America,â€ insisted LaPierre, whose gulpy, throttled delivery belied the clench of a man in serious need of breathing lessons. Anyone hoping for nuance or even coherence would have been disappointed in his speech, which pounded out a steady drumbeat of fear and alarm. He warned of those â€œother roomsâ€ where â€œpolitical and media elites at the highest levelsâ€ are conspiring to destroy the second amendment, and with it â€œour core values, our freedomâ€. â€œA Clinton White House would be a cesspool for NBC, ABC and CBS elitists to plan programming and orchestrate interviews to bombard the airwaves against our freedom. â€ Elitists are â€œshredding the very fabric of our countryâ€ â€œseizing and destroying all the freedoms and values we care about mostâ€ and planning to â€œput the full weight of a weaponized IRS, ATF, EPA, interior department and every other federal agency behind attacks against groups and people they donâ€™t like. â€ If Hillary Clinton wins, â€œitâ€™s game over for everyone in this room, and everything that we all care aboutâ€. It seems safe to say that the paranoid style in American politics is alive and well. All of the classic elements that Hofstadter described in his 1964 essay were on full and florid display at Louisvilleâ€™s Freedom Hall: conspiracy, persecution, apocalypticism, the characterization of political difference not as a matter of good faith but a final showdown between absolute good and absolute evil. â€œWe will save freedom!â€ LaPierre shouted in closing. â€œAnd America truly will be America again!â€ He ceded the podium to NRA president Chris Cox, who announced the NRAâ€™s official endorsement of Donald J Trump for the office of president of the United States, then Trump himself took the stage to offer his thoughts. In that essay, Hofstadter took pains to point out that the US has never had a monopoly on the paranoid style. As proof, he cited the one instance in modern history of the paranoid styleâ€™s â€œconsummatory triumphâ€ a distinction that belongs to Germany in the era of the Third Reich. While in Louisville I made it my business to follow the trail of another native son of the city, a near contemporary of Hunter Thompsonâ€™s. I went to his childhood home on Grand Avenue, a neat, modest, pink house with a historical marker out front. I saw the gym where he trained as a youth, and toured the museum and cultural center that bears his name. Two weeks later these places would become crowded with people mourning Muhammad Aliâ€™s death, but at the time I was visiting these sites out of the sense that for a demonstration of rugged American individualism, you would be hard pressed to find a more salient example than Ali, nÃ© Cassius Marcellus Clay, who as a practicing Muslim renounced participation in that â€œprimary industryâ€ that Hunter Thompson talked about. For refusing military service during the Vietnam war, Ali lost his world championship title, his boxing license â€” and thus his means of making a living â€” and who knows how many millions of dollars in future earnings. His indictment and trial in federal court led to a sentence (later overturned by the supreme court) of five years in jail, the maximum penalty allowed. With the wrath of the law and mainstream America bearing down on him, Ali still refused to bend. He wasnâ€™t scared of going to jail, of never boxing again, of trading his fame for infamy. Faced with the loss of pretty much everything a person can hold dear, Ali wasnâ€™t afraid, which years later moved his friend Bill Russell to say: â€œAli was one of the first truly free people in America. â€ As a loud, proud black man in the early 1960s who did his own thinking and spoke his mind, Ali blew out several of the hottest circuits in Americaâ€™s paranoid wiring. â€œI donâ€™t have to be what you people want me to be,â€ he famously declared. Mainstream, ie white, America freaked, and then came the conversion to Islam and his refusal of military service as the Vietnam war escalated. At a time when paranoid delusions were driving the US into a catastrophic war, Ali saw it for the fraud it was his was a mind free of unreasoning fear, which isnâ€™t to say he had little to fear. For refusing the draft, he lost his freedom.

Despite the albumâ€™s critical acclaim, Ocean evaded interviews and has only spoken publicly sporadically, often on Tumblr, where he has written about his sadness over Princeâ€™s death and Donald Trump. But Tuesdayâ€™s intensely personal post described his reaction to the Orlando shooting and the history of hate towards the LGBT community. â€œI heard on the news that the aftermath of a hate crime left piles of bodies on a dance floor this month,â€ Ocean said. â€œI heard the gunman feigned dead among all the people he killed. I heard the news say he was one of us. â€ Ocean continued to say the last time he saw his father was at lunch when his dad called their waitress a faggot â€” the first time Ocean had heard the derogatory word, aged six. â€œMany donâ€™t see anything wrong with passing down the same old values that send thousands of kids into suicidal depression each year,â€ Ocean said. â€œSo we say pride and we express love for who and what we are. Because who else will in earnest?â€ While Ocean has kept quiet over the past four years, fans and the music press have been anxiously awaiting the to Channel Orange, in part because of the artistâ€™s hints of its imminent arrival on social media. And the latest reports say that the album was premiered at a listening party in New York City earlier this year. The blogpost made no mention of the next album, though its personal themes were reflective of the lyrics in Channel Orange. Ocean wrote in the post that reality seems â€œbleakâ€ and he hopes that attitudes will soon change. Ocean said: â€œI daydream on the idea that maybe all this barbarism and all these transgressions against ourselves is an equal and opposite reaction to something better happening in this world, some great swelling wave of openness and wakefulness out here. â€",0
"417","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/24/john-prine-songs-music-review-nashville-first-album-concert","Mark Guarino","John Prine walked onstage around 10. 40pm Thursday holding a vinyl copy of his 1971 debut album. â€œI had to pay $7. 50 on eBay to get this thing!â€ he told the audience. What happened next was priceless: two sets of music that spanned his career including, for the first time, a performance of the album, John Prine (Atlantic) in its entirety. That album allowed the former Chicago mailman to quit his day job, move to Nashville, and become one of the songwriters of his generation. You can hear why in its 13 story songs, which quietly eavesdrop on the lives of marginalized Americans: a Vietnam vet turned heroin junkie, an elderly couple forgotten by the world, a convict eating Christmas dinner behind bars, a Kentucky town ravaged by a coal company, a wife caged by a small town and loveless marriage who yearns for the rodeo. The album helped launch the era of the 1970s and remains a touchstone for how empathy, ordinary language and minimal detail can produce the weight of an entire novel. The night was also an unexpected break for Prine, who has been touring large theaters across the US behind a new album of duets, For Better or Worse (Oh Boy). But on Thursday, abandoning his formal suit for denim and a black Prine performed for about 200 people at the Station Inn, Nashvilleâ€™s legendary den for bluegrass musicians. The wood panelling, folding chairs, and yellowing showbills on the wall fit the humble lyrics, but the music, with guitarist Jason Wilber inflecting textures, measured up to Bob Dylanâ€™s take on Prine: â€œPure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mind trips to the nth degree. â€ The concert, part of the Americana Music Festival and Conference, was a highlight among panel discussions and special events around the city. In a city where songs are currency, at a conference where songwriters are king, and in a venue championed as a showcase for both, the night was like Christmas, New Yearâ€™s Eve and the Fourth of July wrapped into one. Prine turns 70 in October and has survived two bouts with cancer, with scars visible on his neck. Yet Prine growls his words softly, his voice ragged but not rough. When he delivers the grim coda of Six Oâ€™Clock News â€” â€œHis brains were on the sidewalk and blood was on his shoesâ€ â€” it is with resignation, the saddest kind of horror. With Wilber and longtime bassist Dave Jacques at his sides, Prine expanded his touring band with a Jack White sideman, Fats Kaplin, on fiddle, accordion and pedal steel guitar, the Pat McLaughlin on mandolin, and the drummer Kenneth Blevins. On Hello in There, their playing brought the room to silence. As Jacques stretched a long bow across his acoustic bass and Kaplan let notes hover in the air from his accordion, Prine sang the heartbreaking lyric of an old man and his wife, forgotten by their children. On Angel From Montgomery, a song made ubiquitous by Bonnie Raitt (â€œIf you go into an igloo and thereâ€™s a girl singer on the stage, if you sit there long enough, sheâ€™ll sing this songâ€) Kaplanâ€™s fiddle and Wilberâ€™s guitar called back and forth to one another as they swirled around the lyrics. Prine noted that, despite their 45 years, many of his earliest songs hold special relevance today. Sam Stone, written in the throes of the Vietnam conflict, could easily be written about todayâ€™s veterans returning home from the Middle East. Your Flag Decal Wonâ€™t Get You Into Heaven Anymore, another throwback skewering war hawks. â€œThis one I really thought wouldnâ€™t last for six months,â€ he said. â€œI bring it out whenever we have an election. â€ But the song that holds personal relevance to this day is Paradise, written for his parents, both originally from Muhlenberg County, territory in western Kentucky. Prineâ€™s lyric about Peabody Energy Corp, which stripped the area for mining decades ago, has infuriated the company for years : in court documents filed last year against environmental activists, the company described the song as inflammatory. â€œTo me, it wasnâ€™t a protest song, but when Peabody heard it, they went apeshit,â€ Prine noted said. â€œThatâ€™s what started the war between us. â€ In April, he noted, the company filed for bankruptcy. The second set featured another hour of music from Prineâ€™s career. Jason Isbell and his wife, Amanda Shires, joined him on guitar and fiddle for three songs, including a haunting version of Unwed Fathers. Between two songs, Prine mentioned that the guitar he was holding was the same one pictured leaning against a stack of hay bales on the cover of that 1971 debut. â€œI bought it new in 1968 and wrote every song on it,â€ he said. The guitar received its own round of applause.",0
"418","https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jun/06/us-economy-federal-reserve-interest-rate-rise","Jana Kasperkevic","Hikes to US interest rates might be on hold again thanks to â€œconsiderable uncertainty about the economic outlookâ€ Janet Yellen suggested in a speech on Monday. Speaking at the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, days after a surprisingly poor report on the state of the US job market, the Federal Reserve chair said gradual increases to the interest rates were â€œlikely to be appropriateâ€. But she omitted the phrase â€œin the coming monthsâ€ â€” a phrase that, when spoken by Yellen 10 days ago, many economists took to imply that the Fed was ready to raise rates soon. Among the factors that might persuade the Fed against raising interest rates next week are slowing job creation and US economic growth as well as uncertainty about the UKâ€™s potential exit from the European Union (Brexit) and a slowdown in Chinaâ€™s economy. â€œEven though the financial stresses that had emanated from abroad at the start of this year have eased, global risks require continued attention,â€ said Yellen. China still faces â€œconsiderable challengesâ€ and investorsâ€™ perception of risk can change abruptly, she said. â€œOne development that could shift investor sentiment is the upcoming referendum in the United Kingdom. A UK vote to exit the European Union could have significant economic repercussions,â€ she said. Yellen did not elaborate as to what those repercussions could be. Yellenâ€™s speech came three days after the US Department of Labor announced that the US economy had added just 38, 000 jobs in May â€” 122, 000 fewer than expected. The disappointing numbers have been attributed to the fact that 40, 000 Verizon workers had been on strike for 44 days. The strike ended 10 days ago. â€œThe economy added 2. 7m jobs last year, an average of about 230, 000 a month,â€ Yellen pointed out Monday. She also noted that wages had gone up, job openings were up, the US economy was â€œfairly closeâ€ to full employment and that people were quitting their jobs, signalling that they were receiving other offers. â€œThis past Fridayâ€™s labor market report was disappointing,â€ said Yellen, adding: â€œLet me emphasize that one should never attach too much significance to any single monthly report. â€ Last time Verizon workers went on strike, in August 2011, the US economy reported that zero jobs were added. The following month, that number was revised to 57, 000 jobs, and the month after to 104, 000 jobs. The Fedâ€™s committee meets next week, on June. There will be no revisions to the jobs report prior to that. The Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the the first time in nearly a decade last December and two more rate hikes have been expected this year. The next Fed meeting will take place in July, weeks after the June report and the Brexit vote. â€œIn short, nothing too surprising after Fridayâ€™s employment report left little doubt that there would be no tightening at the June FOMC meeting,â€ said Jim Oâ€™Sullivan, chief US economist for High Frequency Economics. â€œThe speech is consistent with tightening again before too long, but there is no specificity at all on timing. â€",0
"419","https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/nov/18/skiing-sundance-film-festival-park-city-utah-us",NA,"Bombs were falling in the distance, shaking the house like a hurricane. We were in the basement, hiding. â€œDonâ€™t worry,â€ a father next to me told his daughter. â€œItâ€™s just a giant walking through our city. â€ Suddenly, a flash of blinding light tore through the ceiling and I raised my hands protectively over my head and let out an involuntary little shriek. Yes, virtual reality stole the show at this yearâ€™s Sundance Film Festival, Robert Redfordâ€™s annual shindig of snowy mountains and independent movies in Park City, Utah. At the New Frontiers exhibition, goggled people were tiptoeing gingerly across flat floors like they were on a tight rope, and a woman covered in sensors endlessly circled a blacked out room. Everyone seemed to be wired up â€” pointing and ducking at absolutely nothing. It felt like an asylum for the chronically entertained. But one thing VR canâ€™t yet imitate is the rush of the real outdoors. Luckily, thereâ€™s plenty of that nearby, which was the other reason I was here: to combine mountains and movies, popcorn and pistes. For a film buff, a trip to Park City during Sundance was the ultimate winter treat. This year it got a little better too. After a $50m investment, Park City Ski Resort, home of the US Ski Team and the 2002 Winter Olympics, expanded into neighbouring Canyons, built a new gondola to link the two resorts and created the largest ski area in the US: 17 peaks and 7, 300 acres of skiable terrain. Hitting the slopes here isnâ€™t so much an outing as it is a expedition, albeit one fuelled by hot chocolate and whisky toddies at the bottom of every run. The festival itself is a strange mix of ski bum and movie mogul. But it works. â€œYou see a few actresses in heels,â€ one local told me, with a wicked glint in her eye. â€œBut they soon fall on their ass in the snow. â€ Thatâ€™s not to say thereâ€™s no glamour. I narrowly missed Steve Carellâ€™s bum as he jumped into a taxi, and I shared a ski lift with Olympic Gold freestyle mogulist Hannah Kearney, who had just given Adrian Grenier (Vince from Entourage) a lesson â€” which was cool on two counts. There might have been more â€” is quite tricky in a blizzard â€” but the St Regis, where I stayed in neighbouring Deer Valley, was all the I needed: outdoor hot tubs right on the slopes, a funicular railway just for getting to the lobby and a bloke who sabres bottles of champagne (as in cuts the cork off with an actual sword) every night. Eat your heart out, Vinny. But it was the skiing that really stood out. Starting at the far western end of Park City, it took me a whole day to ski to its eastern edge, seven miles away, without ever repeating a run. I raced through steep pine forests pillowed with heavy snow and frozen aspens, the Wasatch mountains rolling by in swirls of purple and brilliant white. The runs were long and varied, the snow light as air. And because Sundance was on, the slopes felt empty. â€œItâ€™s the best time to ski,â€ one local winked. On my last day, after a storm, I had my first taste of Utahâ€™s legendary powder, dropping into a steep bowl and gliding through the trees in mesmeric silence. It felt like flying. I saw great films too, from weird to genuinely moving. I flipped from a bizarre number about a woman falling way too in love with a wolf to a documentary about competitive endurance tickling. One minute I was wiping my eyes at the incredibly powerful Jim: The James Foley Story, and immediately afterwards I was trying to keep my dinner down at a midnight screening of Antibirth. It was like falling down a of kaleidoscopic sensations. Thatâ€™s what makes Sundance special â€” itâ€™s a picâ€™nâ€™mix for the eyes. Screenings were packed, people cheered, and directors spoke. It was about as raucous as going to the movies gets, but not pretentious. Before I arrived I thought the town might become Hollywood, but I was pleased to see Hollywood become the town. Itâ€™s also beautiful: a main street on the mountainâ€™s edge, lit with fairy lights and packed with bars, restaurants and galleries. But, during Sundance, you need to plan ahead. Everything sells out, accommodation is at a premium and cinema tickets packages are expensive and must be booked well in advance or itâ€™s fastest finger first (the real Sundance wouldnâ€™t have had a problem with this) on the festival app waiting list. Thereâ€™s also a tangible difference between the first half of the festival and the second. In the end, it was the New Frontiers programming, celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, that really caught my eye. There were more than 30 VR experiences on display, from seeing the forest through the eyes of insects and owls to living with sea gypsies and Maasai warriors. I watched my body transform into a dark angel and flapped my arms to fly away, I travelled from the blue icebergs of Iceland to a motorbike shop in Japan and then, in the Guardianâ€™s own project, I spent six agonising minutes in a solitary confinement cell. These were more than just films, I realised these were tools for creating genuine empathy. The more I saw, the more I felt on a cusp of a brave new world â€” like witnessing the switch from radio to TV. Why watch someone elseâ€™s story when you can be the star of your own? â€¢ The trip was provided by Visit Utah, Visit Park City and Deer Valley. Accommodation was provided by St Regis Deer Valley (doubles from $313). America As You Like It has a holiday to Park City departing 19 January 2017, from Â£1, 842pp, including flights, transfers and accommodation at the St Regis Deer Valley but excluding festival tickets.

"420","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/05/shunned-by-white-america-how-muhammad-ali-found-his-voice-on-campus-tour","Les Carpenter",", Time had sanitized the past. Portraits of Muhammad Aliâ€™s activism in the wake of his death at 74 on Friday paint a picture of a fighter who helped change American culture with his refusal to be drafted into the US military but cannot explain how dire his situation actually was in 1967. Much of America hated and feared him. He was facing five years in prison for saying no to the military. He was through as a fighter, stripped of his license by the New York State Athletic Board and facing a long court fight to overturn his conviction. â€œEveryone turned on him,â€ fellow boxer George Foreman told CNN on Saturday. â€œI mean literally everyone. I hadnâ€™t even gone into boxing yet. No one wanted to be in his presence. No one wanted to be his friend and he was dropped. â€ This was one of the toughest parts of Aliâ€™s life. As his backers in the Nation of Islam pushed him further into activism, much of white American shunned him. His passport had been taken away. He complained, at one point that: â€œIâ€™m not allowed to work in America and Iâ€™m not allowed to leave America. â€ And yet the period â€” at the height of his sporting powers, from when he refused to step forward as draft officials in Houston called his name to 1971 when the supreme court overturned his conviction and sentence â€” helped shape the Ali who would later become beloved. It became the time that he grew into his voice. Ali embarked on a series of college tours across America delivering lengthy soliloquies on his faith, his decision to conscientiously object to the war in Vietnam, and his experiences of racism in America. At first the speeches were stunted, narrowly repeating Nation of Islam dictums. But quickly Ali began to thrive, sparring with students who challenged his views and delivering characteristically pithy retorts. In one adversarial speech, just months after the assassination of Dr Martin Luther King Jr in April 1968, Ali told a packed auditorium at Union College in Schenectady, New York: â€œWe donâ€™t hate white people â€” we know them too well. â€ Adding: â€œAnd the only solution to todayâ€™s racial problems is separation. â€ According to college newspaper reports the entire address was received with cheers, applause and laughter. Ali, dressed in a silk suit, continued: â€œEven Tarzan, king of the African jungle, is a white man swinging around each week with diapers on. â€ Bill Siegel, director of the documentary The Trials of Muhammad Ali, argued these years not only helped Ali forge his dissident voice, but showed him he was part of a broader, younger, grassroots movement. â€œIt forced him to become even more himself and develop himself as an independent thinker, and also to recognise that he had allies that he didnâ€™t know he had, meaning white college students, who were coming around to where he was,â€ Siegel said in an interview. But the tours were also born out of financial necessity. Ali, then in his and a young father, could no longer make a living from boxing following his criminal conviction. Ali ended his address to students at Union college with a short rhyme: â€œI like your school and admire your style, but your pay is so small, I wonâ€™t be back for a while. â€ â€œItâ€™s one thing to be a marcher at a symbolic rally,â€ civil rights leader Jesse Jackson told CNN on Saturday, â€œ[But] he lost of all of his wealth, he almost became a pauper, [going] school to school giving speeches because heâ€™d gave it all up for his principles. That made him a very different guy. â€ Former Washington Post and Atlanta Journal Constitution columnist Dave Kindred, who knew Ali well and wrote a book about the fighterâ€™s relationship with broadcaster Howard Cosell called Sound and Fury, believes Ali enjoyed the college tours. â€œI think he was surprised at finding an audience that he never really knew existed,â€ Kindred said. To Kindred the hardest thing about that time for Ali was that he could not fight between the ages of 24 and 29, which are the peak years for most athletes. As successful as his boxing career was, he might have had even greater success in the ring had his license not been taken away. â€œI donâ€™t think he suffered much in other ways,â€ Kindred says. â€œMoney didnâ€™t matter to him at all. He wanted money just to get by. The Nation of Islam was supporting him as best as they could. â€ Ali feared the Nation and their leader Elijah Muhammad. After Aliâ€™s friend and adviser Malcolm X was banished from the Nation by Muhammad and later assassinated, Ali worried the same thing could happen to him. He once told Kindred he didnâ€™t want the Nation to kill him, too. â€œAli was not a leader, he was a follower,â€ Kindred says. â€œAli wanted to be guided â€” as independent and eccentric as he wanted to be. He attached himself to leaders. All the racist harangues, the â€œwhite man is the devilâ€ â€” that was the Nationâ€™s ideology and he became its most vocal mouthpiece. He was coached by the Nation. â€ But Aliâ€™s words were heard. The more he spoke them on college campuses and the more they reached new ears, the bolder he became. â€œHe loved the sound of his voice,â€ Kindred said. â€œHis voice at that time was getting a lot of attention. â€ After the heavyweight champion retired in 1981 that voice grew silent, however. Aside from the occasional commercial or interview he did not appear much as his body started to feel the effects of Parkinsonâ€™s disease, which slowly took away his ability to move and speak. He was no longer the raging presence in the ring or on college campuses. He was just gone, before the world as the surprise at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. â€œI donâ€™t think there was any relationship with America,â€ Kindred said. â€œThen when he reappears frail and trembling and vulnerable he was embraced. It was kind of a guilt. Look at what he gave for us as a fighter. â€",0
"421","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/climate-change-voters-2016-election-issues","Ed Pilkington","The race for the White House is failing to grapple with the key issues of the day, especially the urgent need to combat climate change before atmospheric changes become irreversible, a slice of the American electorate believes. As the primary election season turns toward a between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there is increasing anger and frustration over the nature of the contest. A Guardian to online readers in the US asking them to reflect on the race so far was met by a barrage of criticism on the tone and substance of the worldâ€™s most important election â€” with the two main parties, individual candidates and the media all coming under heavy fire. The Guardian asked readers to identify the â€œone issue that affects your life you wish the presidential candidates were discussing moreâ€. Resoundingly, the largest group of participants pointed to climate change. Of the 1, 385 who responded to the â€” from all 50 states â€” one in five expressed discontent at the relative silence from candidates around a subject that they believed to be of supreme and epochal importance. They noted that much of the Republican debate has either focused on blatant denial that climate change even exists or on how to unpick Barack Obamaâ€™s attempts to fight global warming, while on the Democratic side both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have raised the issue but have rarely pushed it to the top of the political agenda. Many of the respondents vented despair at a political system that in their view allowed a matter of such overwhelming significance to be so overlooked. â€œThe fact that no one is really talking about climate change, to me, is indicative of just how lost we are,â€ said Linda Hayden, 51, from Oregon. â€œOur house is on fire and we are arguing about who is more angry!â€ Vivid words and phrases were used to articulate the scale of the pending disaster that readers accused the presidential hopefuls of ignoring, such as â€œcataclysmicâ€ â€œrunning out of timeâ€ â€œthreat to human lifeâ€ â€œpath towards destructionâ€ or in one particularly memorable remark: â€œ apocalypseâ€. A reader from Alaska, a state acutely feeling the impact of climate change, used the word â€œDoomed!â€ while an woman from Tennessee who asked to remain anonymous simply said: â€œFreaking global climate change. â€ Jennie Ratcliffe, 66, from North Carolina quibbled with the Guardianâ€™s wording of the question, saying â€œthis is far more than an â€˜issueâ€™ â€” itâ€™s a crisisâ€. â€œIâ€™m a climate scientist, and almost no one in the general public knows just how serious and urgent this really is,â€ said Peter Kalmus, 41, from Altadena, California. â€œNot only is it real â€” itâ€™s terrifying. â€ The concerns of voters came to light as part of the Guardianâ€™s Voices of America series which aims to highlight the way key issues have been ignored or during a primary season when trivial personal attacks seemed to take precedence over substantial debate of issues that matter. The Guardian was not a poll, and as such was not a controlled survey of opinion. But it does illuminate a largely hidden depth of concern, particularly among liberal Americans, about a gathering global disaster that has tended to be discussed, if at all, at the fringes of the presidential debate. Most of the respondents were . About 80% said they planned to support a Democratic candidate â€” by comparison, around 31% of Americans overall describe themselves as Democrat (a higher 49% if you include those who say they are â€œ â€). That disparity is likely to have influenced the fact that climate change was top of the pile of priorities for those who participated â€” only 19 of the 284 respondents who mentioned climate change said they were unaffiliated to a party and just two described themselves as Republican. This ideological gap also plays out in public opinion research which uses a nationally representative sample of respondents. Last year, Pew Research Center found that 76% of liberal Democrats said that â€œglobal warming is a very serious problemâ€ compared to 14% of conservative Republicans. That is perhaps a reflection of a fundamental disagreement among Americans about the reasons for, and even existence of, climate change. Pew found that 64% of Democrats believed global warming was caused by human activity while only 22% of Republicans agreed. Participants in the Guardian project reserved their greatest ire for those Republican candidates who have expressed skepticism on the campaign trail that climate change exists at all. Among prominent GOP contenders, Ben Carson, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio all cast doubt while they were running on climate change science while Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich and Rand Paul argued against the need for urgent action to tackle the problem. The presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, has said he is â€œnot a great believerâ€ in climate change, suggesting it is a hoax put about by the Chinese. When he set out his energy plan, he promised to cancel the Paris climate agreement that commits countries to reduce levels of polluting emissions. Anthony Friedline, 31, of Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, was one of many respondents who expressed frustration at how the subject had been treated during the presidential TV debates: â€œOne party thinks it is a hoax, and on the other side no one wants to discuss it except Bernie Sanders who the media doesnâ€™t want to give the time of day because he isnâ€™t part of the â€˜establishmentâ€™. Who cares about â€˜establishment politicsâ€™ when the fate of the whole damn planet is in our hands and we, apparently, are going to do nothing to fix it?â€ Forest 32, from Oregon, wrote that â€œthe Republicans still havenâ€™t admitted climate change exists, but even Democrats are not making it a priority like they should. Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton have mentioned it, but are not prioritizing it enough. All the candidates act as if this isnâ€™t happening, and everyone knows that it is. Letâ€™s get real folks!â€ The strikingly bleak view of so many American voters towards the presidential election process chimes with the dismay of prominent environmental groups and campaigners who had hoped that the race for the most powerful job on earth would become a channel for serious discussion about how to tackle climate change. Michael Brune, executive director of the 2. 4 Sierra Club, Americaâ€™s largest environmental movement, said: â€œOur members are in shock right now about Donald Trump â€” they are asking how we got to this point and what must be done to stop him becoming president. â€ Brune added: â€œWe feel itâ€™s unconscionable that the overwhelming coverage has focused on the size of Trumpâ€™s hands or how he belittles his opponents, as opposed to how our civilization will be powered and climate change averted. â€ The climatologist Michael Mann, who is director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, said he did believe that Clinton and Sanders had engaged in meaningful dialogue about climate change, and pointed the finger of blame at the media for failing fully to reflect that. He added that as the general election gets underway he hoped there would be more focus on â€œsubstantive and critical differences in the views of the candidates, and less focus on frivolous and prurient matters that serve as little more than distraction and misdirectionâ€. Mann said: â€œThe American people could not have a starker choice before them between a presumptive candidate of one of the two parties who recognizes the risk posted by climate change and articulates solutions, and the presumptive candidate of the other party, who denies that climate change is even real. â€ The of the climate campaign 350. org, Bill McKibben, who Sanders has appointed to the platform committee at the upcoming Democratic national convention, struck a positive note by pointing out that in the 2012 presidential race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, climate change was not raised at all until just days before the election as a result of Hurricane Sandy. â€œThis time around, whoever the Democrat is will be hammering Trump and the rest of the GOP for their blindness to climate science â€” itâ€™s now a losing proposition for them. So, scientists and movements have done their job in that way. â€ But he went on to warn that â€œmerely believing in climate change at this point is way too low a bar. We need leaders who understand itâ€™s the issue of our century, and will work with the focus it requires. â€ Climate change was the most prominent among a host of different political concerns that respondents to the complained were being insufficiently aired during the election. Accounting for one in 10 responses, the next most common group of worries related to tax reform, income inequality and poverty . Similarly high were mentions of campaign finance and corruption in politics, those too made up around one in ten responses. Insecurity was a theme in many of the responses â€” 8% of respondents said they wanted leaders to focus on foreign policy while 7% said job security. Most of our respondents skewed towards the Democratic party. Amongst those who were explicit, 577 said they were Bernie Sanders supporters while just 53 said they were voting for Hillary Clinton.

"422","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/16/china-seizes-us-underwater-drone-south-china-sea","Julian Borger","The Chinese navy has seized an underwater drone in plain sight of the American sailors who had deployed it in international waters, in a seemingly brazen message to the incoming Trump administration. According to a US defence official, the unmanned glider had come to the surface of the water in the South China Sea and was about to be retrieved by the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic and surveillance ship, when a Chinese naval vessel that had been shadowing the Bowditch put a small boat in the water. Chinese sailors in the small boat came alongside the drone and grabbed it despite the radioed protests from the Bowditch that it was US property in international waters. The incident happened about 100 miles of the Philippinesâ€™ port of Subic Bay. The US has issued a formal protest and demanded the return of the glider. Peter Cook, the Pentagon press secretary, said the Bowditch made radio contact with the Chinese ship and asked for the glider to be returned. â€œThe radio contact was acknowledged by the [Chinese] navy ship, but the request was ignored,â€ Cook said. â€œThe UUV [unmanned underwater vehicle] is a sovereign immune vessel of the United States. We call upon China to return our UUV immediately, and to comply with all of its obligations under international law. â€ The aggressive Chinese gesture comes at a time of rising tensions between China and the US in the South China Sea, where Beijing has claimed ownership of a number of reefs and small islands â€” which it is in the process of militarising â€” while the US navy has been conducting patrols nearby to assert freedom of navigation in the sea lanes. The tension has spiked since Donald Trump was elected in November. The US quickly broke a protocol by taking a call from the president of Taiwan, and openly questioned Washingtonâ€™s longstanding â€œone Chinaâ€ policy that does not recognise Taiwan as a separate state. Beijing has signalled it would respond dramatically if Trump implements a break in policy once he takes office on 20 January. In recent days, China has conducted bomber patrols close to Taiwan in a flexing of its military muscle. The seizure of the drone is also a reflection of the struggle occurring under the surface of the South China Sea. As China develops a strategic submarine fleet, with the potential to carry nuclear missiles out into the Pacific Ocean, the US has built up a monitoring network designed to spot Chinese submarines as they leave their bases. Drones are key to the network, and there is a race under way between major naval powers to develop drones that can work together in swarms and â€œseeâ€ long distances through the water. Underwater gliders are drones that can stay underwater on the lookout for submarines for long periods of time. â€œThis looks like signalling from the Chinese in response to Trumpâ€™s Taiwan call,â€ said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the China Power Project at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. â€œIt is hard to believe this is the action of an independent commander. The Chinese now have much better control over the military, particularly the navy. It is in Chinaâ€™s interest to send signals before Trump is inaugurated, so that he gets the message and be more restrained once he is office. â€ Sebastian of the British American Security Information Council said: â€œNuclear states are increasing anxious about unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs, or underwater drones) autonomously tracking their nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) making them vulnerable to antisubmarine warfare. This is an issue for China in particular, whose SSBN fleet is small and noisy. Though the USNS Bowditch is an oceanographic ship and may sound harmless, the kinds of data it is collecting will make Chinese submarines easier to find over time. â€œChina therefore accomplishes a number of things by seizing a US underwater drone,â€ said. â€œIt allows Chinese scientists to better understand the USâ€™s offensive technical capabilities in this area, and potentially allows them to them, bringing gains in both the commercial and military spheres. â€ Glaser pointed out that the Chinese have frequently tested the US when there is a new administration. In the early months of the George W Bush administration, in 2001, the Bowditch was involved in a close encounter with a Chinese frigate which turned on its gun control radar and forced it to retreat. A week later there was a collision between a US spy plane and Chinese warplane off Chinaâ€™s Hainan island. At about the same point in the early Obama administration, in March 2009, a number of Chinese navy ships harassed another US oceanographic vessel, the USNS Impeccable, coming as close as 50ft away, trying to snag its acoustic equipment with hooks, waving flags and demanding the Impeccable leave the area.",0
"423","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/wage-gap-black-white-americans","Molly Redden","Black Americans today earn even less relative to their white counterparts than they did in 1979, according to a new report by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI). The report, released by the thinktank on Tuesday, shows that the gap between wages of both black and white men and black and white women has widened over the last 36 years. Black menâ€™s average hourly wages went from being 22. 2% lower than those of white men in 1979 to being 31% lower by 2015. For women, the wage gap went from 6% in 1979 to 19% in 2015. â€œThe finding that stands out the most, our major result, is that the racial wage gaps were larger in 2015 than they were in 1979. Thatâ€™s huge because the impression people have, in general, is we know thereâ€™s still racism in this country, but we think or at least believe that itâ€™s getting better,â€ said Valerie Wilson, director of the EPIâ€™s program on race, ethnicity and the economy and one of the reportâ€™s authors. The EPI report comes a week after the US Census Bureau found that in 2015, median income for white Americans went up 4. 4% and that of black Americans went up by 4. 1%. While everyoneâ€™s income went up in 2015, a large racial divide remains. The median household income for white Americans in 2015 was $63, 000. Thatâ€™s 70% more than the median household income of black Americans, which was $36, 898. One of the main reasons that income for black Americans is not increasing at the same rate as that of white Americans is the starting salaries of college graduates within each group. According to the EPI, black male college graduates â€œstarted the 1980s with less than 10% disadvantage relative to white male college graduates but by 2014 similarly educated new entrants were at a roughly 18% disadvantageâ€. The report was unequivocally grim for black women, especially those who are young. The researchers found that the current wave of inequality has hit young black women the hardest. Since 2000, when the gap began widening, itâ€™s black women just entering the workforce who have seen their wages fall the farthest compared with their white peers. The wage gap between white and black workers is still at its largest between men. But since 1979, the gap has grown fastest among women. years ago, black women earned only 6% less than white women. Today, black women earn 19% less than white women. Differences in educational attainment and other factors, like the fact that black women are more likely to work in the south, explain only a third of that gap. You can see this trend writ small among highly educated black women, Wilson said. At the beginning of the 1980s, black women with a college degree or higher and white women with a college degree or higher earned roughly the same wages. But today, wages for black women with a college degree or higher are 12. 3% less than those of their white counterparts. That is double the disparity experienced by black women with only a high school degree. At the same time that the racial wage gap has widened, the gender wage gap has narrowed significantly. But the effects of racial discrimination have all but erased those gains for black women. â€œThereâ€™s no question that white women benefited more from the narrowing of the gender wage gap than black women,â€ said Wilson. She noted that in the 1990s, while the gender wage gap for white women grew noticeably smaller, for black women, the disparities stayed the same. â€œBlack women are faced with both kinds of discrimination,â€ Wilson said. â€œAnd that racial disadvantage has basically limited their achievements in narrowing the gender gap. â€ The EPI report released on Tuesday included some measures the US could take to close the wage gap between black and white Americans. The suggestions included increasing the federal minimum wage, enforcing laws to prevent â€œwage theftâ€ and discrimination, developing ways to assess the role discrimination plays on wages of black Americans and a summit to address the low starting salaries of black Americans.",0
"424","https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/06/theranos-lab-closures-walgreens-centers-layoffs-elizabeth-holmes","Olivia Solon","Elizabeth Holmes, the embattled founder and chief executive of Theranos, said late on Wednesday that the company will close its clinical labs and Walgreens testing centers in the US. In an open letter posted on the companyâ€™s website, Holmes praised the business that she once boasted would change the world with its inexpensive pinprick blood test, and was once the toast of Silicon Valley. In magazine interviews, TV appearances and keynote speeches she gave around the world, Holmes said the innovation would empower consumers by giving them the ability to bypass the gatekeepers â€” their doctors â€” to get important information about the health of their own bodies. Numerous investors and consumers fell for her story, and at one point the company was valued at $9bn, making Holmes the youngest female billionaire ever. But as the company grew, so did questions about its technology. In a series of skeptical reports starting in October 2015, the Wall Street Journal recounted how even Theranosâ€™s own employees questioned the accuracy of the results of its testing and revealed that government regulators had been looking into the matter. The company aggressively defended itself against the accusations but in summer 2016 began to acknowledge some major defeats. In June, Walgreens said it had terminated its partnership with the startup effective immediately. In July, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services imposed harsh sanctions against Theranos, levying a fine, revoking its certification to operate labs and banning Holmes from owning, operating or directing a lab for at least two years. The company also faces federal criminal and civil investigations into whether it misled investors. The company denies any wrongdoing. Wednesdayâ€™s announcement by Theranos essentially shuts down the operations that were at the heart of the vision Holmes promoted. The move will affect about 340 employees in Arizona, California and Pennsylvania. â€œWe are profoundly grateful to these team members, many of whom have devoted years to Theranos and our mission, for their commitment to our company and our guests,â€ Holmes wrote. The company will now focus its â€œundivided attentionâ€ on its new Theranos miniLab platform, which she described as a product that would be â€œminiaturized, automated laboratories capable of sample testing, with an emphasis on vulnerable patient populations, including oncology, pediatrics, and intensive careâ€. Theranosâ€™s journey is a cautionary tale for the investors and reporters who showered praise on the company with little scrutiny. The firm raised more than $720m in funding before questions were raised over its core intellectual property. What kind of due diligence did venture capitalists conduct before handing over millions of dollars? A number of scientists expressed doubts about Theranos early on, while more cautious investors tend to avoid medical companies unless their core product has been rigorously tested and . Theranos is not the only Silicon Valley company to have doubt cast upon its core science. Former employees said that San vegan food company Hampton Creek, which markets itself as a technology company, exaggerated how advanced its technology was. More recently Bloomberg reported that the company had been engaged in an alleged undercover buyback campaign, where members of staff were tasked with buying up jars of Hampton Creekâ€™s eggless mayonnaise product Just Mayo. The US justice department has since opened up a criminal investigation into whether the company committed fraud.",0
"425","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/nov/16/donald-trump-transition-team-president-us-politics-live","Scott Bixby","You can find our latest wrap of the eveningâ€™s events, with both Clinton and Sanders defending their vision( s) here. Thanks for reading: the live blog will be back tomorrow. Video: Hillary Clintonâ€™s full speech to the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund. One of the key men behind Donald Trumpâ€™s transition to power is a real estate mogul, businessman and publisher called Jared Kushner. He is also married to Trumpâ€™s influential daughter Ivanka, and is in line to be arguably the most powerful to ever set foot in the White House. During the latter stages of the campaign it was Kushner who effectively functioned as Trumpâ€™s campaign manger. He advised him on strategy, drafted his speeches and ran the candidateâ€™s digital media campaign. But eight days after Trumpâ€™s unexpected victory, Kushner is now at the centre of a messy and Shakespearean transition process, variously described as infighting, a â€œStalinist purgeâ€ and a â€œknife fightâ€. On Friday, New Jersey governor Chris Christie was abruptly sacked as head of the transition team and replaced with Trumpâ€™s Mike Pence. Christieâ€™s ousting is thought to be the result of a feud with Kushner. As a federal prosecutor, Christie prosecuted Kushnerâ€™s father, Charles, who was convicted and jailed on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. He got two years in jail, and was released after one. While he was in jail, Kushner took over the running of his fatherâ€™s property business. Earlier this week, two more senior members of Trumpâ€™s team were sacked. They were Mike Rogers, who had been handling national security, and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist and liaison with business and foreign governments. Both were allies of Christie. tall and patrician, Kushner studied at Harvard and New York universities. (According to Daniel Golden, author of The Price of Admissions: How Americaâ€™s Ruling Class Buys Its Way into Elite Colleges, he was admitted to Harvard after his father donated $2. 5m to the university.) At age 26, he was conducting his own . In 2007, he bought an office building on Fifth Avenue for a record $1. 8bn. Most of the cash involved in the acquisition was borrowed. Kushner has one characteristic which sets him apart from Trumpâ€™s entourage: heâ€™s Jewish. (Ivanka Trump converted to Judaism when they married in 2009 the couple have three children who theyâ€™re raising as Orthodox Jews.) Kushner has defended his against persistent accusations of antisemitism, including in a notable piece published by the New York Observer, which he owns. Trump has described his as a â€œgreat guyâ€. The has also reportedly taken the unprecedented step of requesting security clearance for Kushner to attend presidential briefings, the first one of which was on Tuesday. Itâ€™s unclear if the request will be approved. It marks an astonishing departure and invites the accusation of nepotism. Megyn Kelly, speaking with CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper, declared tonight while promoting her new book that Donald Trumpâ€™s lawyer had to be told that if she were to be killed after the lawyer retweeted a demand that she be â€œgutted,â€ â€œit would not help your candidate. â€ America is worth it. Our children are worth it. Believe in our country, fight for our values, and never give up. Because over the past two years, Iâ€™ve met so many people whoâ€™ve reaffirmed my belief in this country. Speaking in New York City, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton declared at a gala for the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund that â€œno childâ€ should live in fear of their parents being deported, or of violence at their schools because of their race or religion. â€œNo child should have to live with fear like that,â€ Clinton said, in an apparent reference to Donald Trumpâ€™s proposals regarding undocumented immigrants currently residing in the United States. â€œNo child should be afraid to go to school because they are Latino, or African American, or Muslim, or have a disability. â€ â€œThere is work to do,â€ Clinton continued. â€œGirls as well as boys, in every country, in every continent, deserve that chance to fulfill their potential. â€ â€œIf they can persevere, so can all of us. â€ On a conference call with reporters tonight, Republican National Committee strategist Sean Spicer and Donald Trumpâ€™s senior communications advisor, Jason Miller, announced that landing teams will be deployed in the coming days to start the transition process and noted that all of those joining landing teams will sign a pledge that they will not serve as a lobbyist at the federal and state level for the next five years. They also noted several of the meetings that the had held with potential cabinet members today, including Alabama senator Jeff Sessions, General Mike Flynn, Georgia congressman Tom Price, Kansas congressman Mike Pompeo and charter school activist Eva Moskowitz. They added that Trump is expected to meet tomorrow with South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, Florida governor Rick Scott and former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, among others. Speaking at a gala celebrating the Childrenâ€™s Defense Fund, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told the audience of philanthropists and childrenâ€™s rights activists that although after the loss of the presidential race one week ago, she wanted to â€œcurl up with a book, maybe my dogs, and never leave the house again,â€ but that she was inspired in part by the stories of the children that the organization helps. â€œThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. Now, sometimes it can feel awfully long believe me, I know,â€ Clinton said, to muted laughter. â€œBut it does bend towards justice. â€ â€œYou donâ€™t get to stop paying rent just because things donâ€™t go your way,â€ Clinton continued. â€œI know that many of you are disappointed in the results of last weekâ€™s election so am I, more than I can ever express, but as I said last week, our campaign was never about one person or even one election,â€ Clinton said, but about â€œbuilding an America that is hopeful, inclusive and bighearted. â€ Watch it live here. Video: Donald Trumpâ€™s name has been stripped from three New York City apartment buildings that he once developed and later sold, after protests from the buildingâ€™s residents that the name was negatively affecting their ability to attract renters and buyers. Kellyanne Conway, adviser for Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team, dismissed reports of problems in forming his cabinet in an interview with pool reporters this evening, and said that new appointments should be announced soon. â€œWe feel really good about the transition,â€ Conway said. â€œI actually would just say itâ€™s false to say itâ€™s not going well. â€",0
"426","https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2016/nov/01/the-view-from-middletown-the-perfect-female-presidential-candidate-doesnt-exist","Gary Younge","As Bea Sousa went to cast her vote early at Muncieâ€™s courthouse a couple weeks ago, the historic symbolism of the moment crept up on her unawares. She paused to take it in. â€œI found myself just standing there for a moment, thinking, â€˜Wow. This is great,â€™â€ says Sousa, 75, the former spokesperson for the League of Women Voters of County, formed from the American movement for womensâ€™ suffrage. â€œI realised for a long time that I would be voting for a woman for president but I didnâ€™t even think about it going into the election room. It lasted only 10 seconds or so. I thought about the women suffragists who had been force fed, who had done amazing things, who had stood up to such abuse. Who put off the fight for womenâ€™s votes during the civil war. Itâ€™s been a long, long journey, And I thought, â€˜This is such a vindication for them. â€™â€ America may be on the brink of electing its first female president. She is in a contest with a man who has been accused of sexual assault in particular and misogyny in general. The gender gap looks likely to be greater than in any previous election. Some women are turning Donald Trumpâ€™s hot mic words against him and wearing â€œPussy grabs backâ€ and changing their Twitter profiles to include the term â€œNasty Womanâ€ after Nate Silverâ€™s FiveThirtyEight website reported a gender split in polling and produced maps showing how Trump would win if only men could vote, Trump supporters started a hashtag on Twitter #repealthe19th, calling for the repeal of the 19th amendment, which delivered suffrage for women. In short, American gender politics has reached a raw and deeply polarised point that this election is both reflecting and accentuating. â€œIn some ways Obamaâ€™s presidency and candidacy brought out more of the racial prejudice that might have been suppressed,â€ says Linda Hanson, the current spokesperson for the LWV in County, who readers suggested we speak to. â€œAnd I think weâ€™re seeing the prejudices in the same way with Hillary. I think her presence is exacerbating the misogyny and drawing it out. â€ But while African Americans, among others, overwhelmingly rallied around Obamaâ€™s candidacy (delivering him 96% of the black vote) and celebrated the prospect of the first black president, Clintonâ€™s campaign has produced more ambivalence and less excitement among women (among whom she enjoys 50% of the vote ). In Muncie, women are divided on Clinton. The most obvious difference is partisan. Like other Trump voters, women who are voting Republican canâ€™t bear her. At last weekâ€™s meeting of the Citizens of Delaware County for Good Government (CDCGG) a conservative campaigning group where half of those in attendance were women, one woman asked: â€œWhat has she ever done for women?â€ Another replied: â€œLook at the kind of women who are standing behind her. â€ } Responses to Trumpâ€™s statements also broadly divide on partisan lines. â€œThey said he was sexist because he called that beauty queen whoâ€™d put on weight Miss Piggy,â€ said one of the women at CDCGG. â€œBut women say that kind of thing about women all the time. â€ When it comes to Trumpâ€™s assertion that he â€œgrabs women by the pussy,â€ Jamie Walsh, who is in her early 30s and whose only previous presidential vote was for Obama in 2008, said: â€œIt does bother me but personally Iâ€™m not easily offended. Iâ€™ve heard worse, Iâ€™ve seen worse, Iâ€™ve experienced worse â€” and all of a sudden these people havenâ€™t heard all these things before. Youâ€™re kidding me. I think the outrage is overplayed for votes. â€ Cathy Day, 48, an English professor at Ball State University who originally backed Bernie Sanders, says: â€œSince Trump has started boasting about sexually assaulting women the importance of her being a woman has definitely started to speak to me more. â€ But like many women here who originally voted for Sanders, Clinton still does not appeal to Day, who displays a sign for every other Democratic candidate in her front yard but the presidential nominee, even if she will vote for her. â€œAs a woman it was kind of hard for me to hear some of the stuff when I was campaigning for Sanders because I think a lot of it came from a place of misogyny,â€ she says. â€œAnd sometimes it was women saying it. But I identify as a woman. My class identity is very important to me and her candidacy didnâ€™t really speak to me on that level. â€ Morgan Aprill, 23, of the Progressive Student Alliance, backed Sanders and is now voting for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. â€œI think itâ€™s extremely important that there could be a female president,â€ she says. â€œItâ€™ll be good for us too and itâ€™s about time. Of course itâ€™s emblematic. I just wish it was a different woman. Iâ€™m voting for another female candidate. â€ Sousa, who says she is not a â€œrabid Hillary fanâ€ herself, believes a higher bar is being set for Clinton than her male counterparts of the past. â€œIâ€™ve met a lot of women who detest her intensely,â€ she says. â€œI canâ€™t take credit for this statement but I heard someone say: â€˜Weâ€™ve gotten used to voting for males we donâ€™t like. Weâ€™ve held our nose and weâ€™ve voted for them for whatever reason. But we arenâ€™t used to doing that with a woman.â€™ Our culture holds women to a higher standard. â€œI always thought that was an excuse not to treat women equally. It hasnâ€™t been that long since women got the vote â€¦ not even a century yet. So you couldnâ€™t find the perfect woman to run for president any more than you could find the perfect African American to be the first president. â€ Views are also shaded quite heavily by race. Sanders won Delaware County, where Muncie resides, but Clinton won handily in Whitely, the black part of town on the east side. â€œIâ€™m 33 years old,â€ says Monique Armstrong, the executive director of Motivate Our Minds which is based in Whitely and offers and recreational activities to children and teens. â€œI remember when Hillary was first lady. Iâ€™m married but I have not changed my name [as Clinton didnâ€™t initially in her career]. Iâ€™m a leader in an organisation. Iâ€™ve chosen to dedicate my professional life to improving the lives of children. So when I think about the things they donâ€™t like about her as a candidate they are probably the same things they donâ€™t like about me. â€ Finally, there seems to be a generational divide. For younger women, who are far more likely to vote for Clinton than older women, the historical relevance of her possible election may not resonate so much. â€œI think itâ€™s very hard for women who are in their 20s or 30s to understand what women in their 60s and 70s went through when they were coming up that age,â€ explains Sousa, who several readers suggested we spoke to. â€œThereâ€™s a lot of women of my age who felt themselves passed over because they were female or were verbally harassed just in thoughtless ways rather than mean ways who do value what she has come through. Women who know that they can get into law school and medical school have a whole different perspective on our history as women. â€ Earlier in the campaign season, the local LWV proposed a forum at which candidates from all the parties could explain their policies as it related to women, as they have often done in the past. The Republicans refused to participate. â€œIf you look at the things we raise as being of concern to our members they are consistent,â€ says Hanson. â€œTheyâ€™ve been there for decades. They are pretty mainstream. But now those positions have been identified by some on the far right as being too far left. So the Republican party chair said the candidates didnâ€™t have to participate in our forum and that meant the Democrats couldnâ€™t either. So it didnâ€™t happen. â€ } Most women Iâ€™ve spoken to in Muncie think the prospects for gender equality are improving both here and beyond, but there is still significant work to do. To that extent it is fairly typical of America. According to a recent poll, women think more progress has been made in overcoming sexism than racism in the past 20 years by a ratio of almost two to one. Roughly of women think thereâ€™s some or a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace and believe women doing similar work are getting paid less than men. More than half of Americans consider Clinton a role model less than half think she is judged more harshly. Muncie elected its first female mayor, Sharon McShurley, in 2008. McShurley served until 2012, and Hanson says women now occupy some important positions guiding the economic and cultural regeneration of the town. But there is still a long way to go. Hanson says McShurleyâ€™s â€œ was criticised in the same ways that Hillary Clintonâ€™s was â€¦ they would still talk about the way she spoke, the way she dressed, it was really sexistâ€. A counsellor at the local womenâ€™s shelter, who works with first offenders in spousal abuse, told Sousa that many of the men he sees havenâ€™t seen women treated with respect and that their experience is thatâ€™s the way men treat women. â€œA lot has changed,â€ says Sousa, â€œbut the underbelly of interpersonal relationships hasnâ€™t. â€ That pause for reflection in the ballot box was important, she says, but she doesnâ€™t want to fetishise it. â€œIt was a moment. But I donâ€™t want to make too big a deal out of it. It should just be something that happens. Itâ€™s too bad itâ€™s taken so long. But I hope her being a woman doesnâ€™t become the main thing about her as she goes forward. That itâ€™s about what sheâ€™s able to do. Once we get past this we can try and move on and take care of the problems this country has because we certainly have a lot of them. â€ }",0
"427","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/07/olympic-games-rio-athletes-personal-finance-struggle","Suzanne McGee","More than 11, 000 athletes marched into Rio de Janeiroâ€™s MaracanÃ£ stadium on Friday night, officially kicking off the 2016 Olympic Games. Only a handful of them, however, will return home to their countries with medals. Even fewer will find monetary rewards for the tremendous investment many have had to make to reach the Rio games. Of course, a tiny handful with particularly compelling stories â€” assuming they bring home gold â€” will sign lucrative deals with sponsors. Michael Phelps, the most decorated summer Olympian in history and a swimmer tipped to win more medals in Rio, already has an estimated net worth in excess of $50m. Simone Biles, the gymnast whose feats have made even veteran coaches gasp in awe, has had sponsors compete for her endorsement, and agreed to put her star power behind Nike, Special K, laundry detergent and a gymnastics equipment supplier (itâ€™s making mats with her signature on them). Itâ€™s safe to say that Biles, too, is on her way to multimillionaire status, if she manages her money well. Not all successful Olympians do. Indeed, they arenâ€™t exempt from some of the same pressures that confront any young athlete that finds himself suddenly making a lot of money. Like most athletes, theyâ€™ve devoted every waking hour and thought to perfecting their performance, and money considerations often go only to necessities plus coaching, equipment and competitions. Visa, the credit card company, has launched a global financial education program at the Rio Olympics aimed at helping competitors take control of their financial futures. Designed in partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) itâ€™s a basic financial education package: an introduction to budgets, saving, money management and bank services . The organizations plan to introduce the program at the Olympic Village with training sessions in the fall. Such programs are sorely needed. Only athletes who compete in sports stand a chance at earning significant sponsorship revenue, and even then, an injury or poor performance can dramatically affect pay. If your sport is something that only appears every few years at the Olympics â€” say, speed skating, or kayaking â€” or you finish fourth, a few fractions of a second out of the medals, itâ€™s reflected in your paycheck. Many Olympians know what that is like: unlike the top female gymnasts, who attract thousands of fans â€” and attendant sponsors â€” many top athletes live close to the poverty line. Want to compete in fencing? Congratulations: be prepared to fork out north of $20, 000 a year. Youâ€™re a budding equestrienne? There are plenty of reasons â€” a stable, a horse, a trainer â€” why royalty (Princess Anne of the UK) and billionairesâ€™ children (Michael Bloombergâ€™s daughter) compete at an elite level. More than 100 US athletes started GoFundMe pages in the to the Rio games, seeking funds for new equipment and to help them cover their basic living expenses while they tried to concentrate on training. Some have even applied for food stamps. Many countries promise medal winners cash prizes. This year India will dole out what could be the sum of 10m rupees, or about $160, 000, to every gold medal winner, $120, 000 to each silver medalist, and $80, 000 for a bronze. Athletes who work for Indiaâ€™s railway system will get extra cash â€” and promotions. China has handed out cash, luxury cars and even new houses. The US will be much less generous: the US Olympic Committee will pay $25, 000 for a gold, $15, 000 for a silver, and $10, 000 for a bronze â€” and medal winners should expect to lose as much as 39% of that in taxes. But for the vast majority of those thousands of athletes, their moment in the sun is simply qualifying for and making it to the Olympics â€” and striving not to end up broke at the end of it. The US Olympic Committee doesnâ€™t help out all that much â€” between 2009 and 2012, according to one analysis, it spent a mere 10. 3% of its budget supporting athletes. An Olympic medalist who is still competing in her sport could expect to collect only about $50, 000 a year. But even medalists do end up broke. Ronda Rousey collected bronze for her prowess in judo in Beijing in 2008 â€” but a few months later was living out of her Honda Accord, unable to afford rent. She became a bantamweight champion for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) a mixed martial arts league â€” and later sold the car on eBay for $21, 300. More tragic is the steep fall from success of another Olympic medalist, Debi Thomas. Featured on Time magazineâ€™s cover in 1986, she became the first African American to win a figure skating medal, capturing bronze at the Calgary Olympics of 1988. She graduated from Stanford and earned a medical degree from Northwestern, and become an orthopedic surgeon. Today, that medical license has expired. Thomas has filed for bankruptcy, and lives in a mobile home with her fiance. She isnâ€™t even sure where to find her skates or her medals. Clearly, thereâ€™s more at work in Thomasâ€™s case than being to deal with the financial realities of â€œnormalâ€ after the Olympics. But athletes and families still dealing with the legacy of all those costs â€” but without the lavish endorsement deals â€” might find it worth their while to quietly spend a few minutes checking out whatever financial planning tools a company offers. The harsh reality of the economics of the Olympics is that some members of the IOC â€” including folks like Prince Albert of Monaco, who probably doesnâ€™t need the extra cash â€” will earn more simply sitting and watching the games than most of the athletes will earn competing. The sponsorship deals are the exception, not the rule. Thatâ€™s a harsh reality that is beyond the control of any Olympian â€” and probably not anything that they should brood over as they prepare to deliver the performance of a lifetime. But win or lose, the athletes face a new challenge: managing their money.",0

The Clinton campaign launched an extraordinary criticism of James Comey, the director of the FBI, who faced anger for his dramatic and late intervention in the race, which deviated from FBI protocol. Comey stood accused of betraying the bureauâ€™s political neutrality, and came under growing pressure to make public everything he knows. The latest twist in a topsy turvy election arrived on Friday afternoon, when Comey said in a letter to Congress the FBI would review whether there was any classified information in new â€œemails that appear to be pertinent to the investigationâ€. In a carefully worded letter, the director said he wanted to â€œsupplement my previous testimonyâ€ about the original Clinton email investigation, which he told Congress had closed this summer, and said: â€œThe FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant. â€ On Saturday, Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said: â€œBy providing selective information, heâ€™s allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts. â€œWhat little Comey has told us makes it hard to understand why this step was warranted at all. â€ It is â€œentirely possibleâ€ that the emails are duplicates of those already studied by the FBI in its earlier investigation into Clintonâ€™s use of a private server while secretary of state, Podesta told reporters on a conference call, adding that Clinton would not be distracted in the final days of the campaign. In July, the FBI closed that investigation. Comey said at the time that Clinton and her aides had been â€œextremely carelessâ€ but not criminal with their email practices. â€œDirector Comey was the one who decided to take this unprecedented step,â€ Podesta said, â€œwe now learn, against the advice of senior justice department officials who told him it was against longstanding department policy of both Democratic and Republican administrations. â€œDirector Comey was the one that wrote a letter that was light on facts, heavy on innuendo, knowing full well what Republicans in Congress would do with it. â€œItâ€™s now up to him, who owes the public answers to the questions that are now on the table, and weâ€™re calling on him to come forward and give those answers to the American public. â€ Law enforcement sources speaking anonymously told news outlets the new emails came from devices belonging to Anthony Weiner, the disgraced former congressman and estranged husband of Huma Abedin, one of Clintonâ€™s closest aides. Agents uncovered the emails during an investigation into whether Weiner sent sexually explicit text messages to a teenage girl. Podesta said Abedin had fully cooperated with the FBI investigation from the start. â€œSheâ€™s been fully cooperative. We of course stand behind her. â€ Robby Mook, Clintonâ€™s campaign manager, said: â€œThe more information that comes out, the more overblown this entire situation seems to be. That in turn has raised more questions about director Comey from his colleagues in law enforcement circles, to take this extraordinary step just 11 days out from a presidential election. â€ Mook highlighted a â€œstartlingâ€ Washington Post report that senior officials in the justice department had warned Comey not to go public but he ignored their advice. He also claimed that, based on anecdotes from the ground, Clintonâ€™s supporters were intensifying their efforts to get out the vote. â€œOur volunteers are rallying behind Hillary,â€ he said. â€œThey know what a fighter she is â€¦ Theyâ€™re as upset and concerned as we are here â€¦ This has only increased the momentum that weâ€™re feeling among our activists on the ground. â€ A jubilant Donald Trump, meanwhile, seized on a potential lifeline for his faltering campaign â€” on Friday describing Clintonâ€™s handling of classified information as a scandal â€œbigger than Watergateâ€. With barely disguised anger, Clinton herself demanded the FBI explain itself on Friday. â€œThe American people deserve to get the full and complete facts immediately,â€ she told reporters in Des Moines, Iowa. â€œThe director himself has said he doesnâ€™t know whether the emails referenced in his letter are significant or not. â€ The content of the messages is unknown â€” and may well remain so beyond election day. â€œRight now, your guess is as good as mine, and I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s good enough,â€ Clinton said. Comey is a Barack Obama appointee who was deputy attorney general for George W Bush. As well as the Washington Post, the New Yorker reported officials speaking on condition of anonymity saying that Comey was warned by the justice department before sending his letter to Congress. â€œHe is operating independently of the justice department. And he knows it,â€ one official told the Post. â€œIt violates decades of practice,â€ another told the New Yorker. â€œItâ€™s aberrational. â€ Matthew Miller, who served at the department under attorney general Eric Holder, told the Guardian: â€œI think it was an unacceptable breach of years of department of justice practice and precedent. â€œThe department goes out of its way not to take any action close to an election that could influence the outcome of that election. The FBIâ€™s reputation for independence and integrity is really at the core to their ability to do their job effectively. â€ Miller described Comeyâ€™s decision to provide an unprecedented televised statement at the end of the Clinton investigation in July as â€œthe original sin hereâ€. The director then felt able to answer questions from Congress in more detail than usual, but this is â€œby far the most serious breach of allâ€ Miller added. The former justice department staffer said J Edgar Hoover, the original and controversial FBI director, had done worse than Comey, â€œbut not even Hoover did anything publicly in the closing day of an election that could be seen as tipping the scales. â€ Republicans and Democrats alike expressed bafflement at Comeyâ€™s timing and ambiguous letter. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat with a history of support for the security agencies, condemned Comeyâ€™s conduct. â€œThe FBI has a history of extreme caution near election day so as not to influence the results,â€ she said. â€œTodayâ€™s break from that tradition is appalling. â€ Charles Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, said Comeyâ€™s letter to Congress â€œwas unsolicited and, quite honestly, surprisingâ€. He too said it created more questions than answers. â€œCongress and the public deserve more context to properly assess what evidence the FBI has discovered and what it plans to do with it,â€ Grassley said. Some analysts speculated that Comey felt caught in a bind: if he waited until after the election, or if the new review leaked through back channels, he would have been accused of a . In an internal email sent to FBI employees, he said he was concerned about balance: the need to inform Congress and the American people versus the danger of a misleading impression about emails. â€œIn trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it,â€ he wrote. Early voting is under way in 37 states, nearly 17m votes have been cast, and Clinton has a healthy lead in most polls. â€œI think people a long time ago made up their minds about the emails,â€ she said at her press conference. â€œAnd now they are choosing a president. â€ Though his own campaign has been plagued by one scandal after another, Trump has regularly berated Clinton over the emails, and his supporters at rallies frequently chant: â€œLock her up! Lock her up!â€ On Friday he accused Clinton of corruption â€œon a scale we have never seen beforeâ€. â€œWe must not let her take her criminal scheme into the oval office,â€ he told a rally in New Hampshire. â€œPerhaps, finally, justice will be done. â€ On Saturday, campaigning in Colorado, Trump made an from his months of criticising the FBI and justice department. â€œYou have amazing people at the Department of Justice, and you have amazing people at the FBI,â€ he said. â€œIâ€™ll bet you, without any knowledge, that there was a revolt in the FBI. â€ The FBI began investigating Weiner in September, after a Daily Mail report that a girl had exchanged explicit messages with him. By then, Abedin had already announced a separation from her husband. Trump himself has been accused by several women of sexual assault or inappropriate conduct. He has argued that Clinton â€œenabledâ€ her husbandâ€™s infidelities, and brought three women who accused the former president of wrongdoing to a presidential debate.",0

The Republican presidential nominee wants two of the three debates moved to avoid clashing with televised NFL games. On Sunday, he also said his opponent would prefer such a clash, saying: â€œHillary Clinton wants to be against the NFL. â€ Outlining his argument on ABCâ€™s This Week, Trump said: â€œWell, I tell you what I donâ€™t like. Itâ€™s against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying this is ridiculous â€¦ because the NFL doesnâ€™t want to go against the debates because the debates are going to be pretty massive, from what I understand. â€ He added: â€œAnd I donâ€™t think we should be against the NFL. I donâ€™t know how the dates were picked. I donâ€™t know why those particular dates. â€ On Saturday, in a statement emailed to the Guardian, the NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said: â€œWhile we would obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Mr Trump. â€ The Commission on Presidential Debates is a nonpartisan body, established in 1987. In its statement, it said it was impossible to avoid all sporting events when scheduling debates, and added that presidential debates have never been rescheduled because of conflicts with sporting events. The 2016 debates are set for Monday 26 September at Hofstra University in New York Sunday 9 October at Washington University, St Louis and Wednesday 19 October at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. The debate is on Tuesday 4 October, at Longwood University in Farmville, Virginia. The election is on 8 November. The NFL schedule has the Atlanta Falcons at the New Orleans Saints on 26 September and a full programme of games on 9 October. In its statement, the commission said: â€œAs a point of reference, in a period, there are four general election debates â€¦ and approximately 1, 000 NFL games. â€ â€œYou know,â€ Trump said on ABC, â€œHillary Clinton wants to be against the NFL â€¦ maybe like she did with Bernie Sanders where they were on Saturday nights when nobodyâ€™s home. â€ Supporters of Sanders claimed that the Democratic National Committee deliberately scheduled its primary debates out of primetime, to shield Clinton, a perception deepened by the release of internal DNC emails after a hack which the Clinton campaign and federal investigators believe was carried out by Russian intelligence services. Trump and his campaign have denied any link to such Russian actors. Other top Republicans insisted on Sunday that the schedule remained open for debate. Trumpâ€™s campaign chair, Paul Manafort, told NBCâ€™s Meet the Press: â€œLook, weâ€™re going to sit down with the commission and talk with them. â€œAgain, the DNC [email] hack showed you that the Clinton campaign was working to schedule debates against Sanders which ha[d] the least possible viewing audience. Mr Trump [is] saying, â€˜Look, we want the maximum viewing audience.â€™ So Iâ€™m not sure, you know, what the dates are going to be ultimately. â€œMr Trump has made it very clear as recently as Friday: he wants the debates. He wants them to have the largest audience. And weâ€™re going to work with the commission to try and identify what those dates are. â€œBut weâ€™re not going to fall to Hillary Clinton and the ploy that she did against Bernie Sanders of trying to have the audience. We want the biggest. â€ The Republican National Committee chair, Reince Priebus, also said the GOP was â€œgoing to be working with the commissionâ€ and said Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday nights would attract more viewers. Speaking to CBSâ€™s Face the Nation, Priebus said: â€œWeâ€™re not going to agree with anything that our nominee doesnâ€™t agree with. â€",0
"430","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/02/canadian-hostage-robert-hall-body-found",NA,"Philippine troops on Saturday dug up what they believe is the body of the Canadian hostage Robert Hall, who was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf extremists more than two weeks ago after a ransom deadline lapsed. Villagers led the troops to a hinterland near Kamuntayan village in Sulu provinceâ€™s Talipao town, where the militants buried Hallâ€™s body after killing him on 13 June. Hallâ€™s head was found outside a Roman Catholic cathedral, the regional military spokesman Maj Filemon Tan said. Tan said chances were high that the body recovered on Saturday was Hallâ€™s, citing intelligence reports and help from villagers. Police forensic experts would confirm the identity, he said. Hall was kidnapped with another Canadian, John Ridsdel, Norwegian Kjartan Sikkengstad and Filipino Marites Flor in September last year in a resort on Samal Island, also in the south, and taken by boat to Sulu, a predominantly Muslim and impoverished province 590 miles south of Manila. Ridsdel was also beheaded, Sikkengstad remains in Abu Sayyaf custody and Flor has been freed. Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, condemned the killings and called on other nations not to pay ransoms if their citizens were abducted, to discourage the militants from carrying out more ransom kidnappings. Philippine troops have been carrying out an offensive that has killed dozens of militants in Sulu. The Abu Sayyaf, which has more than 400 armed fighters, is blacklisted by the US and the Philippines as a terrorist group for bombings, kidnappings for ransom, beheadings and extortion. The militants have been weakened by years of battle setbacks but remain a national security threat.",0
"431","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/19/diy-terrorism-new-normal-new-york-minnesota","Aki Peritz","The weekendâ€™s seemingly disjointed events â€” a bombing in New York City, several unexploded bombs discovered in New Jersey, multiple stabbings in a mall in Minnesota â€” has set Americans on edge again. It remains unclear if these acts were part of a grand international conspiracy, or whether a cell or single individuals are behind them. Yet what we do know is that we now inhabit an age in which itâ€™s logistically straightforward to commit attacks designed to kill and create mayhem, and there are clear ideological rationales for doing so. This toxic combination, along with an occasional willingness to die while carrying out the â€œoperationâ€ makes this new foe â€” call him a terrorist or a disturbed individual â€” particularly difficult to thwart. It used to take some degree of preparation to carry off a successful attack, especially in the west. The fact that some bombs in New Jersey and one in Manhattan failed to explode is a reminder that building explosives takes some degree of skill if youâ€™re to be successful. Also, convincing your radical comrades to engage in a conspiracy opens you up to penetration by the cops or intelligence services. That is an additional challenge. But stabbing people in a mall or shooting people in a club requires little preparation. You donâ€™t need any particular specialized training anymore except to pull a trigger, drive a car, be willing to kill and desire to be killed. Weâ€™ve seen this DIY violence elsewhere. For example, the atrocity in Nice, France, killed over 80 people, and while multiple suspects were arrested following the attack only one person carried out the operation. In this instance the assailant, Mohamed drove a large truck into a crowd, crushing scores of people. The carnage only stopped after police shot him dead. Soft, crowded targets are plentiful in our free, open societies. There is little the authorities can do to keep a determined attacker from striking pedestrians enjoying a balmy Saturday night in New York City. Guns, gates and guards can only provide so much protection against a wily, creative adversary who is willing to risk oblivion. What makes confronting these DIY terrorists even more difficult is that thereâ€™s an organization actively and successfully disseminating a message: the Islamic State. Through its slick social media messaging and global network of personal connections, this organization has been convincing the misguided â€” some of whom are lone wolves â€” to cause havoc in their home countries. This is no accident, but a plan terror operations outside Iraq and Syria have and will always be part and parcel of the Islamic Stateâ€™s DNA. For those who wanted to kill people more generally for their own reasons, Islamic State provides them a rationale by which to do so. For example, the San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook bought his weapons years before he killed 14 people at a holiday party. Why didnâ€™t he commit his crime earlier? We wonâ€™t ever know, since he (along with his wife, Tashfeen Malik) is dead, but perhaps Islamic State appears to have given him a reason and a mission to finally take the plunge and destroy himself. As long as Islamic State steadfastly pursues its â€œvictoryâ€ narrative, so long as it survives in one physical form or another, people will use its existence as a warped rationale for murderous behavior. Destroying Islamic State and draining the swamp will go a long way to denting the ideological allure of attacking civilians. At the time of writing, we still donâ€™t quite know the motivations of the NYC bomber or the Minnesota stabber. But we do know that if they were motivated by a jihadist ideology, crushing Islamic State will go a long way to reducing the rationale for this kind of behavior, making our streets safer. This will require sacrifice and great political capital to see it through to the end. Islamic State is fully committed to this conflict, will give no quarter, and will continue to use its power to cause havoc on our streets. Western nations must be committed to defeating Isis. In the meantime, our societies must be resilient enough to absorb â€œinspiredâ€ or â€œdirectedâ€ attacks from the Islamic state and its DIY acolytes for the foreseeable future.",0
"432","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/19/the-good-place-kristen-bell-afterlife-comedy","Brian Moylan","Whatâ€™s the name of this show? The Good Place, When does it premiere? There is a premiere on Monday 19 September at 10pm ET right after The Voice so it can get plenty of attention. Then it settles into its regular time slot on Thursday at 8. 30pm ET, right after Superstore. Oh man, NBC Thursday comedies have sucked lately. Yes, they sure have. The network went broad and in a bid to be CBS and grab some of that Big Bang Theory syndication cash. But that didnâ€™t work (RIP Sean Saves the World) so The Good Place is a return to form of those great Thursdays of years past when 30 Rock, Parks and Recreation and The Office would rule. Mike Schur, who worked on both The Office and Parks and Rec, created this show. So, what is The Good Place? Itâ€™s heaven, silly. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) dies â€” sheâ€™s hit by a billboard truck advertising an erectile dysfunction drug â€” and winds up in heaven. The problem is those at the pearly gates think that she is Eleanor Shellstrop, a selfless attorney who got innocent men off death row, but she is really Eleanor Shellstrop, a selfish jerk who sold fake medicine to elderly people. Is heaven a bunch of fluffy clouds with angels playing lyres? No, heaven looks sort of like a very spiffy suburban strip mall with countless frozen yogurt stores, restaurants with punny names (The Good Plates) and, seemingly, an endless supply of stores selling cardigans and bow ties. Everyones lives in tacky McMansions that you say you would never live in but you totally would if given the chance. This is just one â€œneighborhoodâ€ of heaven and this oneâ€™s architect is Michael (Ted Danson) an angel who has been apprenticing for 200 years and this is his first solo project. Each person who gets to heaven is also awarded a soulmate. Eleanorâ€™s is Chidi (William Jackson Harper) a Nigerian ethics professor who canâ€™t decide whether he should help Eleanor stay in The Good Place or send her downstairs. What happens when this bad girl gets into heaven? She literally breaks it. When she steals shrimp from a party, the finely calibrated divine mechanism of eternity is broken and it results in her neighborhood being attacked by giant flying shrimp. Yes, super gross. Whatâ€™s great about this construction is that it allows for Eleanorâ€™s bad behavior to have immediate and disastrous results, only amplifying how horrible she is and leading her on a path to correct it. This is a great engine for a sitcom because the consequences are extreme and the fixes easy and predicated on being good so that everyone can hug their kids and tell them the world is beautiful before sending them off to bed. Is it funny? Just imagine a woman whose favorite book is Kendall Jennerâ€™s Instagram living in a neighborhood with 322 of the most altruistic, giving, selfless people in creation. Bellâ€™s golden girl looks and devilish behavior are a perfect combination for this role (as is her wonderful comedic timing). Danson proves yet again why heâ€™s one of the best in the business as a hapless angel not used to being human and trying to cover up his errors before any of the higher ups get angry. The jokes let us have it both ways. We get to indulge the devil on one shoulder with Eleanor when she picks on the priggish Chidi, her snooty British neighbor Tahani (Jameela Jamil) or the stuffy customs of the in heaven. But then we also get to focus on the angel on the other shoulder when Eleanor gets her slapstick comeuppance for behaving abominably. Itâ€™s like all the drinking with none of the hangover â€” just like in heaven. Should I watch this show? Yes, you should. Itâ€™s not going to revolutionize television comedy, but itâ€™s a wonderfully sweet, confection thatâ€™s a little bit edgy but still has the wholesome values that will make it acceptable for the whole family.",0
"433","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/17/never-make-ever-again-007-worst-james-bond-rip-offs","Ben Child","The Eurospy era, during which French, Italian and German producers competed to see who could release the cheapest James Bond at the height of the suave British secret agentâ€™s success, may now belong to some deeply dubious 1960s belle Ã©poque, but 007 continues to have his imitators across the globe. Only this week, the makers of the controversial Valley of the Wolves saga, long considered a Turkish answer to Bond, announced plans for a new instalment about the recent failed coup against president Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸanâ€™s government. It will see suave spook Polat Alemdar (Necati ÅžaÅŸmaz) helping to rescue the dear leader from his loathsome military aggressors. Alemdarâ€™s previous missions include the 2011 episode The Valley of the Wolves: Palestine, in which the spy travels to Israel. Once there, a local man threatens him by saying: â€œYou know you wonâ€™t make it out of our promised land. â€ Alemdar responds with disdainful, brio: â€œI donâ€™t know what part of these lands were promised to you, but I promise you six feet under. â€ Knock it if you like, but the franchise is about to enter its fifth movie and has already notched up three TV shows. Yet even Valley of the Wolves pales in comparison with other fabulously terrible offerings from around the world when it comes to ersatz Fleming lunacy. Here are seven to have you choking on your minimally mixed Martini. Released in 1981, the same year as the Roger For Your Eyes Only, For Your Height Only features 2 ft 9â€ martial arts star Weng Weng as the diminutive agent 00. His task is to defeat the perfidious villain Mr Giant, whoâ€™s trying to take over the world with technology, while romancing beautiful women almost twice his height. Featuring heroically shonky dubbing, Eddie Nicartâ€™s film is perhaps most impressive for the variety of techniques tiny 00 uses to take down his much larger opponents. These range from poisoned darts to a remote control flying hat (like a upgrade on Oddjobâ€™s famous Sandringham) and tiny, machine gun. But mostly he just creeps up unseen, thanks to his tiny stature, and chopping his rivals in the back of the legs. How do you get around your lack of rights to any of Ian Flemingâ€™s Bond stories, characters, or themes? Well, in the case of Italian producer Dario Sabatello the answer is to recruit Neil Connery, younger brother of then 007 Sean, as well as Bond girl Daniela Bianchi (Tatiana Romanova in From Russia With Love) and Bond stalwarts Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell (M and Moneypenny respectively in the Eon series). Released under a flurry of unsubtle alternative titles, including OK Connery, Operation Kid Brother and Operation 007, Alberto De Martinoâ€™s movie pitches plasterer Neil (his performance entirely dubbed by an unknown American actor) as Dr Neil Connery, a plastic surgeon bizarrely recruited by a Lee (here named Commander Cunningham) for a mission to take down the evil THANATOS organisation. As if the Bond allusions werenâ€™t enough already, two of the main villains were played by Adolfo Celi (Thunderballâ€™s Emilio Largo) and Anthony Dawson (Dr Noâ€™s Professor Dent). At the end, Lee turns to his successful agent and shamelessly breaks the fourth wall by telling him: â€œOK Connery! You were almost better than your brother. â€ Notable for racy scenes in which Bollywood icon Akshay Kumar frolics with his glistening leading lady in a steaming swimming pool (while singing, naturally) Mr Bond also stars Pankaj Dheer as a apparently villain named Dragon, who boasts a luxurious pet moustache so substantial that it puts Blofeldâ€™s cat to shame. Dragonâ€™s uniquely cruel signature turn of evil involves crushing small children to death beneath a large steamroller: not to be put off, Kumarâ€™s Mr Bond fights back with lots of crooning and disco dancing. The movieâ€™s finest sequence features our hero being sung back to life by a gaggle of tiny kiddies after taking a beating from an enemy henchman. Quite why John fresh from the Lord of the Rings movies, felt the need to appear as an agent for evil terrorist organisation INTERR in this grubby 2001 spy spoof will perhaps never be explained. Part Austin Powers, part Charlieâ€™s Angels, Never Say Never Mind: The Swedish Bikini Team pitches the titular quartet of blonde, models as international crimefighters tasked by mysterious boss Mr Blue (Bruce Payne) with helping friendly governments and worthy private corporations in the fight against evil. The buxom Swedish Bikini Team first came to public attention in a 1991 advert for Old Milwaukee Beer, drawing complaints of misogyny. So at least they had something in common with Flemingâ€™s famous secret agent. When George Lazenby turned down the chance to return as 007 in a sequel to 1969â€™s On Her Majestyâ€™s Secret Service, he probably never imagined it would get this bad. Less than two decades later, the Australian turned up as veteran secret agent Drew Stargrove in the 1986 Never Too Young To Die. A John Stamos stars as the ostensibly Flemingesque lead, Stargroveâ€™s high school gymnast son who takes revenge following the death of his father at the hands of hermaphrodite villain Velvet Von Ragner (a leering, gurning Gene Simmons of Kiss). The bad guyâ€™s signature kill move involves penetrating his victims with a fingernail, a murder method known as â€œthe fingerâ€ and which sounds deeply unpleasant. Licensed to Love and Kill (aka The Man from S. E. X.) was in fact the second in a series of Bond spoofs based around agent No 1 of the Secret Service, aka Charles Bind. But for the 1979 instalment, Canadian director Lindsay Shonteff somehow managed to convince The New Avengersâ€™ Gareth Hunt to take the lead in a battle against sinister organisation K. R. A. S. H. (Killing Rape Arson Slaughter and Hit) its evil boss, the subtly titled Senator Lucifer Orchid, and a dozen nefarious female henchmen, one of whom fights Bind using nothing more than a pair of spinning boobies. Despite being ostensibly set in the US, the entire film was shot in the home counties â€” and it shows. Early on, Bind asks himself: â€œWhat am I doingâ€ and you have to wonder if Hunt was experiencing similar emotions. Maxwell and Lee went moonlighting once again in 1975â€™s From Hong Kong, With Love, this time seemingly appearing as M and Moneypenny in an early cameo, which must have gone down well with Bond rights holders Eon Productions. Yvan Chiffeâ€™s spoof stars the popular Marx French group Les Charlots as a team of spies tasked with taking down the villainous Marty, played by an Mickey Rooney. It was filmed mostly at the Shaw Brothersâ€™ studio in Hong Kong and features a shameless parody of the famous 007 gun barrel sequence in which one of the Charlots apparently shoots himself in the face by accident. Because blowing your own brains out is always hilarious.",0
"434","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/05/muhammad-ali-hometown-louisville-memorial","Matthew Teague","Louisville took the blow like a champ: still on its feet. Fists up. Still jawing. On Sunday morning at 22nd Street and Muhammad Ali Boulevard, the Reverend Larry Williams stood before the congregation at Zion Baptist Church and prayed: â€œWe ask for strength for the family of the great Muhammad Ali. â€ He raised his voice. â€œWe pray that theyâ€™ll have such peace they can come in rejoicing!â€ Since word of Aliâ€™s death arrived on Saturday morning, people across the city have come together in public to remember one of the cityâ€™s sons and to boast of his triumphs over his greatest foes. Not Frazier, or Liston or Foreman. But racial discrimination. Cowardice. War. His funeral on Friday will reflect his multifaceted legacy it will be an interfaith service, open to the public, streamed live on the website of the Muhammad Ali Center. From former president Bill Clinton to sportscaster Bryant Gumbel to Billy Crystal, a constellation of eulogists will try to describe the elements of Aliâ€™s personality â€” the magisterial, the athletic, the witty. And it will be, above all, a Louisville affair. Before the service, Aliâ€™s hearse will drive slowly through the city streets to Cave Hill Cemetery. Ali arose from here â€” from a tiny pink house in Louisvilleâ€™s west side â€” to become the most famous man in the world. He wielded that fame like a left jab. By the time he finished, he had changed the Louisville of his youth â€” a segregated, provincial city â€” for good. â€œNot just Louisville. â€ said his childhood neighbor, Lawrence Montgomery. â€œThe world. â€ Ali started here on Grand Avenue, honing the irrepressible qualities that would carry him to victory inside the ring and out. Montgomery has lived all of his 81 years on the same block of Grand, and as he talked on his front porch his hand moved lightly from scene to scene, outlining ghosts: the site of the old tree, the path to the park, the young Cassius Clay, not yet called Ali. â€œHe was always, eh . .. braggadocious,â€ Montgomery said. â€œI remember him telling me: â€˜Iâ€™m gonna be the heavyweight champion of the world. You watch.â€™ And I just laughed because he was a skinny kid. â€ Listening to Montgomery is like listening to Ali himself, had Parkinsonâ€™s disease not beset him: the accent, the mannerisms, the eyes that always seem just on the verge of winking. â€œI guess that skinny kid showed me,â€ he said. As a man, Ali would always appear to move without effort, never straining, whether dodging punches or political blows. And some of that was temperament. â€œHe was always jovial as a boy. Always joking,â€ Montgomery said. But much of that quality â€” dancing, flickering â€” came only as the result of intense, physical and mental focus. Ali only floated like a butterfly, as he bragged, because young Cassius had plodded liked a mule. â€œI worked at the post office, and in the mornings I remember seeing him pull on his old hobnail boots,â€ Montgomery said. His hand traced a line down the street, following an invisible boy. â€œHe would run to the park and back every day before school. And when the school bus came he wouldnâ€™t get on. He would get his books and run alongside the bus. â€ Eight miles every day, before school. Then the old tree, and more running. â€œHe had. .. â€ Montgomeryâ€™s eyes roamed for a moment, while he searched for the perfect word to describe the running boy, and everything he became. â€œHe had dedication. â€ On the wall of his home, Montgomery keeps a note Ali signed to â€œmy first bossâ€. Montgomery had three children, and employed Ali to babysit them. His daughter Linda said she remembered the two parts of Aliâ€™s personality â€” the playfulness and volume, underlaid by quiet focus. â€œOh, he was funny,â€ she said. â€œHe made us laugh and laugh. â€ But when a boxing match came on the Montgomery family television, he would sit the children in front of it to watch, unmoving, studying, until the final bell. As the radius of the young boxerâ€™s reputation expanded, so did the ferocity of his opponents. On Grand Avenue people grinned and shook their heads, but hoped for his success. The city of Louisville and state of Kentucky, though, were more hostile. The Jim Crow laws were in full effect here, enforcing segregation in every corner of life. Thereâ€™s a story about Ali set in the early 1960s, after his triumph in the Rome Olympics. According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser itâ€™s not true, and the Muhammad Ali Center presents it as a legend. But it matters that in Louisville repeat it with the conviction of faith: after his win, Ali was refused a seat at a diner, and in his disillusionment he climbed a bridge and cast his gold medal into the Ohio river. People here believe that story, polish and cherish that story, because it captures two things that are exactly true. Louisville, and the south at large, was an oppressive home for black people, who had not yet even secured the right to vote. And all of that â€” the established order, the granters of gold medals and diner seats â€” would be revealed as a fragile, opponent by Louisvilleâ€™s brash young man. He threw away more than medals, during the Vietnam war, when he refused to register for the draft. Boxing authorities suspended his license for more than three years â€” three of the most critical, profitable years in a young boxerâ€™s career. Years that, as far as Ali knew, would not end. He could not have predicted historyâ€™s eventual view of Americaâ€™s involvement in Vietnam. â€œTo be honest we all thought Muhammad was losing it,â€ his old friend Montgomery said. â€œIt seemed crazy. What is he doing? It since then we have come around to understand it was his passion. Peace. â€ As his radius expanded to encompass the globe, his paradoxical nature revealed itself again. The worldâ€™s greatest fighter had an underlying aversion to violence. On Sunday afternoon in a plaza outside the Muhammad Ali Center, a crowd gathered to place flowers, pictures, boxing gloves and trinkets at a memorial. One of them was Amal Salom, who was visiting from Iraq and wore a head scarf as she took photos with her iPad. She is 58, and said some of the first images she remembers beaming out from her familyâ€™s television were of Muhammad Ali in the ring. The sport astonished her â€” men pummeling each other â€” but she said her strongest memory of Ali was from 1990, when he visited her country. â€œHe came to tell my president to not make war with Kuwait,â€ she said. She was referring to one of Aliâ€™s least known achievements, and perhaps his most important. On the eve of the US bombardment of Baghdad, Ali spent time there negotiating with Saddam Hussein, trading stories with a man with an ego to match his own, without the underlying humor. After a week he brought home 15 US citizens Hussein was holding hostage, and delivered them to their families. â€œI remember he told us, â€˜Peaceâ€™,â€ Salom said. Lawrence Montgomery, Aliâ€™s his old friend and first employer, was right. Not just Louisville. The world.",0
"435","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/nov/08/afghan-girl-sharbat-gula-rejects-offer-to-suspend-deportation-from-pakistan","Jon Boone","An Afghan woman made famous by a photograph taken of her when she was 12 has turned down a offer to suspend her deportation from Pakistan, a country she first moved to as a child refugee. Sharbat Gula instead plans to return to Afghanistan on Wednesday, where she will be hailed as a national heroine in a scheduled meeting with the countryâ€™s president, Ashraf Ghani. Gula, now 44, has become the unlikely focus of a tug of war between the Afghan and Pakistani governments following a backlash over her arrest in October and conviction for living illegally in Pakistan under a forged identity card. A court ordered she be deported after serving a jail term and paying a fine of 110, 000 rupees (Â£850). Ijaz Khan, an academic at Peshawar University, said the arrest and trial had caused â€œdeep embarrassmentâ€ for the government. â€œA lot of people are connecting the way she has been treated with refugees in general, who have been treated in a very way,â€ he said. Over the past year, Pakistan has dramatically stepped up its efforts to encourage the estimated 2 million Afghans living in the country to return home. Many refugees claim they have been harassed by police, who have used the crackdown as an opportunity to extort bribes. The campaign has undermined Pakistanâ€™s boasts about its generous hosting of one of the worldâ€™s largest refugee populations. Gula, who appeared as the â€œAfghan Girlâ€ on the front cover of National Geographic magazine in 1985, has been raising her four children alone after the death of her husband. She is in poor health and is being treated in a Peshawar hospital. At the time of the photograph, taken by Steve McCurry, she was living in one of the sprawling refugee camps that were home to Afghans who had fled to Pakistan to escape fighting between Islamist rebels and the Soviet communist government in Kabul. She was found again in 2002 by National Geographic and given a stipend to live off, although there has been controversy in recent days over whether she received all of the money. News of her arrest drew sharp criticism from some Pakistani politicians, particularly from parties representing Pashtuns, the ethnic group to which Gula belongs. â€œTargeting the most vulnerable refugee population has upset and embarrassed the people of Pakistan,â€ said Bushra Gohar, from the Awami National party. â€œSharbat Gulaâ€™s case has exposed the poor treatment meted to the Afghan refugees in Pakistan. â€ On Saturday, the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) the province where Gula was living and was arrested, offered to cancel her deportation. But family members said she had rejected the offer after initial confusion over paperwork a KP government functionary had asked her to sign that she thought was a hospital discharge notice. â€œIt was an oath and affidavit saying that she wanted to stay in Pakistan but we prepared a fresh application saying she canâ€™t wait to leave Pakistan,â€ said Naimat Khan, a relative who has been staying by her bedside at Lady Reading hospital in Peshawar. â€œShe was grabbed from home and sent to jail so obviously she does not wish to live here in Pakistan any more,â€ he said. The family allege that she was targeted only after a local police officer learned she had money from selling her small house in Peshawar. A grand welcome is planned for her return to Afghanistan, where billboards with her photograph have been erected. After crossing into Afghanistan at the Torkham border post she is due to fly to Kabul for a meeting with Ghani. An Afghan government official said she will be given a house. Abubakar Siddique, a journalist from Radio Free Europe, said Gulaâ€™s case had provoked deep anger in Afghanistan, a country where sentiment is already high. â€œThis is an impoverished, vulnerable woman, treated harshly and detained after living in the country for 40 years,â€ he said. â€œIt was seen as violating the Afghan notion of honour. â€ The crackdown on refugees has come at a time when relations between the two neighbouring countries are in a deep trough, with Afghanistan furious at Pakistanâ€™s refusal to crack down on the sanctuaries enjoyed by Taliban leaders inside its borders. Ghani has responded to Pakistanâ€™s pressure on refugees by encouraging them to cross the border with a â€œgrass is green in my landâ€ public relations campaign. Despite the warm words there are serious doubts the Afghan government can cope with the huge influx of people, in addition to the large number of people displaced by fighting within the country. million Afghans, many of them born in Pakistan, are expected to have moved to Afghanistan by the end of the year. Officials say the surge in numbers is due partly to the decision to increase the amount of money paid by the UN to those returning refugees who are â€œregisteredâ€ to $400 (Â£323) a person.",0
"436","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/07/phyllis-schlafly-conservation-women-legacy","Megan Carpentier","Phyllis Schlafly, the founder of the Eagle Forum who died on Monday evening, is best known for her grassroots movement that prevented ratification of the equal rights amendment in the 1970s. But conservative women say that it would be a mistake to think of her as solely involved or interested in countering the feminist agenda. They credit her reach as spreading far beyond that, to empowering women in the conservative movement, many of whom now lead their own national womenâ€™s groups whose areas of focus have broadened to include â€œfree marketsâ€ â€œpersonal libertyâ€ and â€œfamily valuesâ€. â€œIt wasnâ€™t a womenâ€™ cause that she led,â€ explained Lil Tuttle, the policy director at the conservative Claire Booth Luce Policy Institute. â€œIt was a conservative cause. â€ â€œShe encouraged us to speak out and speak boldly,â€ Tuttle added. â€œShe was a uniter in a lot of ways. â€ Tuttleâ€™s organization works to â€œprepare young women for conservative leadershipâ€ and promote conservative leaders. Its board members include Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, and Marji Ross, the president of the conservative Regnery publishing house. Its speakers bureau includes Bay Buchanan, the sister of conservative presidential candidate Pat Buchanan who, with Schlafly, forced the Republican partyâ€™s platform to eliminate all references to exceptions in 1996 and Lila Rose, the founder of Live Action who, with conservative filmmaker James Oâ€™Keefe, participated in a series of stings against Planned Parenthood clinics. â€œPerhaps it is part of her legacy that conservative women found their voice,â€ mused Tuttle. â€œShe certainly promoted activism. â€ Schlafly got her start in politics writing about and campaigning for conservative candidate Barry Goldwater in 1964 because of her interest in opposing communism, and gained renown when she turned a grassroots movement of conservative women â€” many of whom were mothers with little prior political activism â€” into a force that could not only credibly counter but defeat the ratification of the equal rights amendment. The ERA, which at one point had been part of both the Republican and Democratic party platforms and the culmination of decades of work by womenâ€™s rights campaigners, was just three states shy of ratification when Schlafly began her campaign against it in 1972. Galvanized by the US supreme courtâ€™s 1973 decision legalizing abortion in Roe v Wade, Schlafly and her volunteers began knocking on doors and delivering homemade baked goods to state legislators, claiming that a amendment to the US constitution guaranteeing women equal rights would force women out of the home and into the workplace, add them to the ranks of military draftees and combat veterans, institute universal unisex bathrooms and force everyone to perform marriages, among other then terrifying visions of the future. Schlafly won, defeating the ERA, but lived to see the US supreme court legalize marriage, the US military accept women in combat roles, Congress poised to require women to register for the selective service, and even the issue of bathrooms â€” the subject of her last published column â€” come to the fore. Nearly 60% of adult women now work outside the home, comprising 47% of the overall US workforce, and equal pay remains the top issue for working women, Americans tell pollsters. And though by the time Schlafly gained political prominence there were individual Republican women who had been elected to national office, her efforts led to the founding of the Eagle Forum in 1975, an influential conservative organization with active state chapters often led by women. Cathie Adams, who has served on the national board for several years and was the president of the Texas chapter of the Eagle Forum, said that Schlafly â€œwould look across America and lift us up into leadership rolesâ€. â€œIt was a wonderful place to go learn, and Phyllis Schlafly was a wonderful mentor,â€ she added, noting that Schlafly and the Eagle Forum taught generations of women how to lobby and advocate for conservative causes at the state level. But Adams, Schlaflyâ€™s daughter, and several other board members are now embroiled in two lawsuits with the president of the organization over the Eagle Forumâ€™s future and their continuing presence on the board. Adams doesnâ€™t plan to stop her work with the organization. â€œIâ€™m still a member of the national board for which Iâ€™m most grateful,â€ she wrote in a statement. â€œItâ€™s a position appointed by Phyllis Schlafly to continue her legacy into the future. â€ Charlotte Hays, who serves as the cultural director of the Independent Womenâ€™s Forum, acknowledged with an appreciative laugh that Schlafly â€œdrove the feminists crazyâ€. But she agreed that Schlafly pioneered conservative womenâ€™s activism on more than just womenâ€™s issues. â€œShe was involved in every movement of the Reagan yearsâ€ and not just opposing the issues championed by feminists. â€œShe was just absolutely indomitable, absolutely essential,â€ said Hays. The Independent Womenâ€™s Forum focuses on the issues of â€œfree markets and personal libertyâ€ and counted Trump campaign manager Conway among its board members until she recently took a leave of absence, and Lynne Cheney, the wife of the former among its board directors emeritae. In an interview with NPR, Penny Young Nance, the president and CEO of Concerned Women for America, credited Schlafly with her own organizationâ€™s success. â€œI stand today on her shoulders in that I have a national platform to speak about the life issue and conservative issues,â€ she said. The CWA considers itself one of the frontline organizations in Americaâ€™s ongoing culture war, promising to â€œbring Biblical principles into all levels of public policyâ€ by focusing on issues of â€œthe family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education, sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israelâ€.",0

The Indiansâ€™ veteran outfielder was suspended 162 games without pay by Major League Baseball on Wednesday after testing positive for Ipamorelin, a growth hormone releasing peptide. Byrdâ€™s lawyer Jay Reisinger said in a statement that Byrd tested positive because of a tainted supplement. Byrd wonâ€™t pursue an appeal, Reisinger said. â€œMarlon is devastated, but understands that he is responsible for the supplements he takes,â€ Reisinger said. Itâ€™s Byrdâ€™s second violation of Major League Baseballâ€™s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program. Shortly after he was released in 2012 by Boston, Byrd served a suspension for testing positive for Tamoxifen, a medication used by body builders but also to treat breast cancer in women and men. In 2014, MLB increased its penalty for a second offense in 2014 from 100 games to a full season. A third suspension would result in a lifetime ban. In February, New York Mets pitcher Jenrry Meija became the first player to receive that sanction. Byrd, Meija and New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez are the only players to receive suspensions. Even if heâ€™s able stay clean, at 38, Byrdâ€™s playing days appear over. He signed a $1m contract as a free agent in March with Cleveland, which needed veteran outfield depth because both left fielder Michael Brantley and right fielder Lonnie Chisenhall were recovering from injuries. Byrd has been productive, batting . 270 with five homers and 19 RBIs in 34 games â€” mostly against . He went 4 for 4 with a homer on Monday night against Texas, and then struck out three times in a loss Tuesday. He spent last season with Cincinnati and San Francisco. Byrd broke in with Philadelphia in 2002. He was an in 2010 with the Chicago Cubs, one of 10 teams heâ€™s played for. Following his first suspension, Byrd signed with the New York Mets in 2013. To replace Byrd on the roster, the Indians recalled outfielder Tyler Naquin from Columbus.",0
"438","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/07/student-debt-30s-40s-election-issues","Megan Carpentier","People who live around Albany are used to having to explain that being from New York does not automatically mean that youâ€™re from New York City. It can be annoying to be constantly explaining that unemployment is lower, housing is less expensive, there are definitely more people than cows and it is, after all, the center of the stateâ€™s government, even if New York City folks believe theyâ€™re the center of the universe. But for many or fortysomething residents of the state capital, about 150 miles north of Manhattan, their student debt is still weighing them down, despite their having aged out of the twentysomething demographic that is the focus of public student debt sympathy. â€œI pay $700 a month in student loans and I didnâ€™t go to a fancy school,â€ explained Deanna Fox, 30, a writer who lives in Delanson, to a table full of people in their 30s and 40s gathered at the Riverfront Bar and Grille in Albany. â€œBut there really wasnâ€™t any opportunity as far as scholarships go: because I came from a very family, I was too wealthy â€” even though we didnâ€™t have much â€” to get a lot of grants or scholarships, and wasnâ€™t wealthy enough for my parents to pay for me to go to college out of their own pockets. â€œSo I had to take out probably 75% of my funding for college as a loan, and most of it was private loans. â€ â€œI also pay $700 in student loans a month,â€ said Emily Lemieux, a museum professional living in Albany, â€œand I also didnâ€™t go to fancy schools. â€ Young millennials get more attention for their student loan burdens, but students faced such hefty burdens nearly 15 years earlier. Most people in their 30s and early 40s went to college just as tuition rates began their meteoric climbs, and at or around the time when the federal government got out of the student loan game and turned over the origination of federally subsidized loans to private companies like Sallie Mae. These students entered the working world at either the end of the first tech bubble, shortly after in the middle of two wars or at the start of the Great Recession. This demographic is nearly as likely as millennials are to identify as political independents â€” especially in Albany, where about 30% of registered voters opt out of identifying as either Democrats or Republicans. Thatâ€™s about average outside of the New York City area. Anna Varney, a old account executive with the digital marketing company Overit, said: â€œI specifically went to [the State University of New York at] Albany so that I wouldnâ€™t have student loans, so I limited all of my life choices, in a way, because I didnâ€™t want student loans, because I knew that would limit me down the road. â€ Varneyâ€™s colleague at Overit, Jennifer Van Iderstyne, said, â€œThere has been this slow rise in the cost of higher education thatâ€™s really happened over the last couple of decades to the point where it was burdensome on those of us who were in school 10 years ago. Itâ€™s an impossibility for those who are heading into it now. â€ â€œWeâ€™re struggling to survive with those debts,â€ she added. â€œThey donâ€™t even have a chance. â€ Latham resident Ben Backes, 35, who works in biotech, jumped in. â€œThe cost of college over that 15 years . .. has kept going up, and so itâ€™s just like, it seems like youâ€™re paddling upstream and the current is taking everybody with it. â€ Fox was focused, too, on the opportunity costs of having to take out loans to fund her education. â€œI think about how I could put that money towards my own childrenâ€™s education I couldâ€™ve put more of a down payment on my house that I bought,â€ she said. â€œYou know, 70 years ago, people had limited choices but they also had more choices,â€ mused Fox. â€œYou could become a farmer and it would pay for your family. You could become a doctor and you wouldnâ€™t be mired down in debt for the rest of your life. â€ Lemieux said: â€œI just think about my grandpa, who went to world war II and he came back and he went to work at GM. He had six kids and his wife never worked, and they had a summer home, and that was like, their whole life was his job. â€ â€œCan you imagine having six kids on one income now, for somebody that didnâ€™t go to college?â€ she asked. â€œYou could have two people go to college and still . .. â€ She trailed off, the meaning clear to everyone at the table. But while almost everyone was in similar economic circumstances, Jeff Cutler, a software engineer who lives in Cohoes, New York, felt there were others to blame besides college administrators. â€œIâ€™m a bit later in my career than everybody else â€” I paid off my student loans, things like that â€” and Iâ€™m very concerned that the government is not working, or our politicians,â€ he said. â€œThey have some ideas that have been fed to them over the years that they double down on, they triple down on. And so itâ€™s really not addressing the concerns of average Americans. â€ Van Iderstyne agreed. â€œI believe that the absence of term limits and the existence of being a politician as a lifetime career, for many of these people, leads them to make compromised decisions that are not really in the best interest of the people or fixing our problems,â€ she said. â€œWhen you have half the government, half of our elected officials saying, â€˜We donâ€™t think government works, we want to get rid of government,â€™ how is government ever going to work?â€ asked Cutler. â€œI want it to work because Iâ€™m sending a quarter to a third of my salary there. I want it to work well!â€ One example of politiciansâ€™ failure to effectively govern is infrastructure, the group agreed. Van Iderstyne said: â€œI went to school at Suny [the State University of New York] Potsdam â€” thatâ€™s way up north, like, Suny Canada. There were, like, hundreds of miles up there that are basically inaccessible,â€ making it impossible to attract economic development that could sustain residents. Fox said itâ€™s not just physical accessibility that needs improvement. â€œThereâ€™s no internet, thereâ€™s no broadband, thereâ€™s no phone service,â€ she said. â€œPart of that you canâ€™t really help youâ€™re in the middle of the Adirondacks. But at the same time, I live 20 miles from here and I have no broadband. â€ â€œIt costs from a business standpoint I would say that the cost is prohibitive,â€ noted Backes. â€œBut isnâ€™t that why we have a federal government? To find some way to offset some of those costs, so that the people who choose to live in those areas, or canâ€™t afford to get out of them â€” which, back to the education thing â€” theyâ€™d have some options?â€ â€œThe fact is that it may not make sense, economic sense, to have broadband out where you are,â€ Cutler said. â€œHowever, from a standpoint of society, itâ€™s very important to have that there. And for America in general, actually, ultimately itâ€™s better for business â€” but the return on investment takes so long that a business might not be willing to do that. â€ And that brought Cutler to one of his biggest concerns when he hears people advocating for a businessman to run the government. â€œBusinesspeople have different concerns than what we need for effective government,â€ he said. â€œAnd the idea that a businessman will magically be able to solve all the problems â€” theyâ€™re not concerned about what the average person needs, theyâ€™re worried about numbers and profits and loss. â€ â€œThatâ€™s exactly it!â€ exclaimed Backes. â€œShort term! Everything I feel like Iâ€™ve heard this election cycle, and every previous election cycle is, â€˜Well, what are you going to do for me today?â€™ â€” because thatâ€™s whatâ€™s on most peopleâ€™s minds, because of their crippling debt. â€ He added: â€œSo the role of government, for me, is to have these visions and to be able to help that. â€ Fox added: â€œHaving a businessman? Businesses are the ones that are financing campaigns. And so it seems like the general American populace is completely eradicated from the political process besides pandering to get their votes. â€ â€œSo many of the problems weâ€™re talking about arenâ€™t really made or broken on the presidential level,â€ said Van Iderstyne. â€œThis is all in Congress. The president gets eight years, period, but your congressman can be there years. â€œSo whatâ€™s his incentive to take a pay cut or to enact campaign finance reform thatâ€™s going to negatively affect his ability to make TV ads the next time around?â€ she asked. â€œI donâ€™t trust any of them,â€ said Backes. â€œBut I donâ€™t cast my vote necessarily for the one I trust. â€œFor me, most of our elections really seem to come down to the lesser of two evils. The least of three,â€ he added. â€œEvery election comes down to that,â€ said Varney. â€œI feel like it speaks to the character of the kind of people who are now attracted to politics,â€ said Van Iderstyne. â€œAnd also what you have to be and what you have to be willing to accept in terms of invasion and living your life in a fishbowl. â€ â€œUnfortunately, it feels like the people who are the smartest people to solve those problems are too smart to get involved,â€ Fox piped up. â€œI think itâ€™s definitely become more polarized,â€ said Fox. â€œAnd I think that part of the problem, too, is that there hasnâ€™t been a unifying issue that people really connect over. â€ â€œYou would think the recession would have been a unifying issue you would think war against terrorism would be a unifying issue,â€ said Varney. â€œYou would think mass shootings in our schools would be unifying issues,â€ said Van Iderstyne. â€œBut theyâ€™re not. Itâ€™s too divisive. â€ â€œThereâ€™s two ends of that discussion,â€ said Fox. â€œThereâ€™s â€˜take away your gunsâ€™ or â€˜keep your gunsâ€™. Itâ€™s seems like thatâ€™s the only thing that people can focus on. â€ â€œItâ€™s so black or white,â€ said Backes. â€œItâ€™s not,â€ said Varney. â€œWe could have nuance. â€ Lemieux added: â€œIn a school shooting, everyone doesnâ€™t unify around getting a solution. Theyâ€™re opposite. And then we having nothing. â€",0

In November, Young spent his 71st birthday performing for those at the Dakota Access pipeline protest site, and on Monday, in a long Facebook post, he requested Obama step in and â€œend the violenceâ€ against protesters. â€œThe camp grows as winter comes,â€ he wrote together with the actor Daryl Hannah. â€œStanding in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty. â€ â€œIt is an awakening.

We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately. â€ He then turned his attentions to Donald Trump, who he refers to as the â€œsurprise presidentâ€ saying he brings a â€œbounty of opportunityâ€ and his tenure will highlight the â€œgreat issues of our timeâ€. â€œThe surprise president claims he does [not] believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways,â€ he wrote. â€œDo not be intimidated by the surprise presidentâ€™s cabinet appointees as they descend the golden escalator. Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders. The golden tower is not yours.

He ended the post with an appeal for people to be inspired by the Standing Rock protesters and stand up to the administration. â€œBe counted,â€ he wrote. â€œBe like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock.

When future scholars of literature reflect on the way that we wrote in this tumultuous, summer, what will they focus on? Perhaps it will be the way these utilitarian missives shifted towards a particular kind of magical thinking. â€œIâ€™m away,â€ these messages say, dropping into my inbox one after another, â€œand I have limited access to email. â€ Limited access wasnâ€™t always our collective ambition. Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, when was but a dream for the masses, I recall a television commercial that often aired during my fatherâ€™s favorite basketball games. A tropical beach, a business executive kicking back with a clunky, laptop. This was the exciting future of work: going somewhere beautiful but still being able to show everyone how important you were by bringing your 30lb ThinkPad, kicking back with a couple of spreadsheets and a piÃ±a colada. Now, a generation later, with unprecedented portability, connection, we feel the urge to note our limitations, or the ones that weâ€™d like to envision that we have. We are : with staring at screens, yes. But also with anticipation of how important weâ€™ll feel when we look at our inbox after two, three hours away, note the stack of communiques at which we will sigh, with which weâ€™ll reluctantly cope. This is progress: the demonstration of status not through our ability to work wherever we go, but our inability to work. Our distance. Our ability to divide between the mundanity of life and the sublimity of vacation. Our genuine and admirable devotion to personal time and space. Or at least our desire to have that devotion: our understanding that it is something to aim for. A wish. â€œLimited access to email,â€ we write, wilfully overlooking the existence of smartphones, playacting as if every hotel in the world doesnâ€™t place the password in our sweaty palms along with our room key cards. We are aloof, too good to feel a thrill at the buzzing notification that our high school friend has posted a photo of the time that we all went to a water park. This is magical thinking because everyone knows that with rare exceptions we are perfectly able to access our email whenever we feel like it. And we always want to, pretty much: when we announce via Twitter that we have too many emails, that weâ€™re tired of them all, itâ€™s because we want people to know of the demands on our time: our significance to other people, even when most of the other people are the Bed Bath and Beyond 20% off coupon. â€œLimited access to emailâ€ means: â€œIâ€™m at my momâ€™s condo in Miami, but I could be in a treehouse in the Galapagos. â€ It means: â€œI did not just look at my â€™s Instagram while eating cured meat for breakfast with my new, possibly less boyfriend. â€ Itâ€™s dignity, itâ€™s distinction, itâ€™s . Itâ€™s â€œI have limited access to email but you, the person reading this email, have plenty of access to email. You have access to this very email that is telling you that I do not have access to email. â€ But itâ€™s also: â€œI have limited access to email and you have plenty of access to email, a wealth of access, a surfeit. But you know that Iâ€™m reading this, in case itâ€™s important. Just in case. Just in case. â€",0

An increasing number of Chinese rockets have launched in the past few years but this one was significant for three reasons. It was the first launch of the new Long March 7 rocket, designed to help the Chinese place a space station in orbit. It was the first liftoff from Chinaâ€™s newly constructed Wenchang launch complex, a facility set to become the focus for Chinese space ambitions. And it was the first Chinese launch where tourists were encouraged to go along and watch. For a space programme that has long been shrouded in secrecy, itâ€™s a major step. The Wenchang complex has been designed with large viewing areas, and in the sultry heat of that June night, tens of thousands of spectators stood cheering as the rocket began its 394km journey above the Earth and into orbit. â€œChina is developing very rapidly into one of the major space players,â€ says Fabio Favata, head of the programme coordination office at the European Space Agencyâ€™s (ESA) directorate of science. China launched a pioneering â€œhack proofâ€ quantum communication satellite, called Quantum Experiments at Space Scale, on 16 August from its older Jiuquan launch centre in the Gobi Desert. This is the first satellite designed to investigate the weird quantum phenomenon called â€œentanglementâ€ that so unnerved Albert Einstein he once called it â€œspookyâ€. In addition, China is preparing to launch another new rocket design, a new space station, an telescope and a crewed mission before the year is out. China is estimated to spend around $6bn a year on its space programme. Although that is almost $1bn more than Russia, it is still a fraction of the American space budget, which is around $40bn a year. Despite its large budget, the US made only 19 successful space launches in 2013, compared with Chinaâ€™s 14 and Russiaâ€™s 31. With numbers like this, it is clear that China has arrived in space, and is set to become stronger. â€œYou will see the Chinese quite visibly begin to match the capacity of the other spacefaring powers by 2020,â€ predicts Brian Harvey, space analyst and author of China in Space: The Great Leap Forward . Key to this will be the large manned space station, Tiangong, which they plan to have in orbit by then. Although not as physically large as the International Space Station America, Russia, Europe, Japan and other countries have been building and using since 1998, Chinaâ€™s space station will have a broadly similar capacity to perform science. â€œScience is becoming more and more important in the Chinese space programme,â€ says Wang Chi of the National Space Science Centre, Chinese Academy of Sciences. â€œWe are not [just] satisfied with the achievements we have made in the fields of the space technology and space application. With the development of the Chinese space programme, we are trying to make contributions to human knowledge about the universe. â€ Perhaps most impressive is the broad front on which the Chinese space programme is advancing. They are making strides in everything from human space flight to space science and planetary exploration. So do the Chinese want to take over space? Brian Harvey, space analyst and author of China in Space: The Great Leap Forward, believes the Chinese simply want to be seen as equals. â€œTo use a Chinese phrase, I think they are wanting to bring their own mat to the table,â€ he says. â€œThey are looking for equality, they want respect from the worldâ€™s space community. â€ To that end, Chinaâ€™s biggest inroad has been made with the ESA through the space science programme. Soon after the turn of the century. ESA launched the Cluster mission to study â€œspace weatherâ€ and the electrical malfunctions this could cause on satellites. The Chinese were keen to learn more about space weather too and came to the European agency with a proposal: they would build extra satellites to enhance the Cluster mission if ESA would collaborate with them. â€œThey understood that space weather was a key challenge as we rely more and more on technology in orbit,â€ says Christopher Carr, a physicist at Imperial College, London, who worked on the Cluster mission. ESA took care of the negotiations, allowing scientists, including Carr, to build the instruments unhindered. Although there were some differences in working methods that had to be ironed out, Carr says: â€œOverall it was an enjoyable collaboration. â€ The Double Star mission was launched in 2003 and became Chinaâ€™s first scientific satellite. Cluster and Double Star have so far produced 2, 300 science papers. â€œThat is an enormously successful, astonishing scientific output,â€ says Carr. China has gone from strength to strength. In December 2015, it launched the Dark Matter Particle Explorer, a satellite to look for the mysterious matter that astronomers believe makes up a large fraction of the universe. This December, it plans to launch the Hard Modulation Telescope to look for black holes. ESA and China are working together on a new mission â€” the Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (Smile) which is slated for launch in 2021. The Chinese know that the value of these collaborations extends way beyond the science. â€œWe are the newcomers in space science, and donâ€™t have much experience,â€ says Wang Chi. â€œInternational collaborations are the shortcut for China to catch up with the world. In addition, science, especially space science, should be the responsibility of all humans around the globe. International collaboration is the effective way to obtain the maximum science return from any space mission. â€ Favata agrees: â€œAt ESA we collaborate with all major spacefaring nations. If Smile works well it is likely to be the pathfinder for future missions. â€ In stark contrast is America, where there is a blanket ban on working with China that dates back years. The most obvious consequence of this has been the exclusion of China from the International Space Station. But far from slowing the Chinese down, the cold shoulder has actually speeded them up. Circling above us at the moment is the disused shell of Chinaâ€™s first space station. The Tiangong 1 (Heavenly Palace) was launched on 29 September 2011 and hosted two crews between 2012 and 2013. It is now abandoned and expected to Earthâ€™s atmosphere some time later this year. The Chinese will launch Tiangong 2, a second test station, next month. It will lead to a substantial orbital facility that will be in use by 2020. Known simply as Tiangong, it will be a key base for space research, with two large science modules joined together by a connecting service module. â€œThey can do a lot of science on it. It will have a research capacity that the ISS didnâ€™t reach nearly as quickly,â€ says Harvey. China is not planning to keep Tiangong all to itself. In June, it signed an agreement with the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs to open the station to experiments and astronauts from UN member states, specifically developing countries that find space too expensive at the moment. And running the experiments is where Chinaâ€™s astronaut programme comes in. There have been just five crewed space flights since 2003, and none at all since 2013. This is deliberate. â€œThe idea is to take a significant step forward each time,â€ says Harvey, â€œand theyâ€™re not going to cut corners in terms of safety. â€ For the next decade, the Tiangong space station is likely to be the principal destination. Their crew capsule is called Shenzhou (divine vessel). It looks similar to the Russian Soyuz modules probably because the Chinese bought Soyuz technology in the . This same agreement saw the training of two Chinese astronauts at the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia, who then returned to China and trained more astronauts themselves. Twelve Chinese astronauts have now been into space, including Liu Yang who became the first Chinese woman in space on Shenzhou 9 in 2012. Assuming the Tiangong 2 gets to orbit in September, then Shenzhou 11 will follow on 16 October, carrying two people whose identities have yet to be made public who are scheduled to spend a month on board. Looking to the future, the Chinese have already begun testing the larger replacement of the Shenzhou capsule. A version flew on the June flight of the Long March 7 from Hainan. This larger vehicle will be capable of taking up to six crew to the full Tiangong space station or on missions to lunar orbit. It was the secondary payload, Aolong 1 (Roaming Dragon) on that launch that raised eyebrows, and stoked fears in some quarters that the civilian space programme is just a front for more covert operations. Aolong 1 has a robotic arm that can grab another satellite and guide it to burn up in Earthâ€™s atmosphere. Officially, it is to remove space debris from orbit but it could also be used as a weapon, bringing down a rivalâ€™s satellite. Although this is true of any space debris removal system, doubts remain because China does not have an unblemished record in weaponry. In 2007, the Chinese shot down one of their own orbiting spacecraft in what was probably a thinly veiled warning to America. Chinese concerns had been growing since 2002 when the US withdrew from 1972â€™s Missile treaty, which paved the way for President George W Bushâ€™s administration to develop weapons systems. Since that time, concern over Chinaâ€™s militarisation of space has persisted in America. To others, however, that is little more than paranoia. â€œI think the military element in the Chinese space programme is overstated,â€ says Harvey. â€œItâ€™s based on a misreading of the fact that their facilities are protected by the military. Itâ€™s a bit like saying the US military controlled the Apollo programme because the US navy took the returning astronauts out of the ocean. It doesnâ€™t stand up. â€ The military may not be in the driving seat, but it does launch about % of Chinaâ€™s space missions. The Yaogan series of satellites are billed as remote sensing missions but analysts believe they are actually spy satellites. â€œI suspect they are entirely military missions. Iâ€™ve never seen any scientific papers from the Yaogan missions,â€ says Harvey. It is this American fear of Chinaâ€™s military thatâ€™s been driving the ban on collaboration, in particular the prevention of technologies being transferred to China by mistake. But now ESA has found a way to allow collaboration without the loss of control. It is â€œan elegant solutionâ€ says astrophysicist Graziella at University College London, who is working on Smile. â€œChina builds the basic spacecraft and sends it to Europe. ESA and its collaborators then attach the payload module, which holds the science instruments, and launches the mission. That way, no western tech goes to China. â€ When it comes to rockets, China continues to develop a formidable arsenal of launch vehicles. Their rockets are called Long March and have been in development since the 1970s. The mainstay of their complement is gradually being replaced by the Long March 5, 6 and 7. While the Long March 7 in June was capable of lifting about 13 tonnes into low Earth orbit, it is the Long March 5 that analysts are really excited about. Due to make its maiden flight this autumn, itâ€™s capable of lifting 25 tonnes to low Earth orbit, rivalling anything the Americans, Russians or Europeans currently have. It is not yet known what the Long March 5 will send into orbit, but the giant rocketâ€™s second flight, scheduled for next year, will be carrying a very special cargo. It will be a robotic mission designed to land on the lunar surface and send back samples of moon rock to the Earth for Chinese scientists to analyse. The Chinese call their lunar exploration mission Changâ€™e, after the Chinese goddess of the moon. In December 2013 Changâ€™e 3 hit the headlines after it successfully deployed a small rover on the lunar surface. Despite some technical problems, it continued to return data until just a few weeks ago. Now, China plans to land a similar mission on the far side of the Moon in 2018. This will be a world first. â€œThe Russians did think about such a mission in the 1970s but they never got much further than paper studies. This is real, the spacecraft is already built,â€ says Harvey. Also in the advanced planning stages is a rover to go to Mars. Pencilled in for launch in 2020, the Chinese Mars mission is going to find itself racing Nasa and the ESA, which have their own Mars rover missions launching that year too. But what about a human landing on the moon? There could be no bigger sign of Chinese competency than that. Sure, America did it almost 50 years ago but with each passing year Apollo seems to have less relevance to the modern exploration of space. Nasa has held back from committing to a new round of lunar landings. Russia and ESA would both like to go to the moon but canâ€™t go it alone. The Chinese, however, seem to have the lunar surface in their sights. Designs for a Long March 9 rocket are currently being studied. With the first launch for the Long March 9 due in 2025, China could very well be in a position to land astronauts on the moon by 2030. This puts it roughly with America, which currently plans to send astronauts to lunar orbit in 2023 but which has made no commitment to returning to the surface. Almost certainly this will be a flashpoint, but the ignition of a new space race would be a mistake. The Apollo programme of the 1960s cost the equivalent of hundreds of billions of dollars for little more than technological . Better now, surely, to cooperate, spreading the cost and the benefit across the world. The Chinese space programme is gaining momentum year upon year. Its power lies not in unlimited funds but in carefully chosen projects, and the pursuit of clearly targeted goals â€” something the traditional space powers could learn from, especially when is comes to the crewed programmes. At present there is no agreement on what to do when the current agreements to use the International Space Station come to an end in 2024. With America continuing to talk about hugely expensive missions to Mars, but with no real plans or budget in place to do this, Russia and ESA could increasingly find that their space ambitions are more aligned with those of the Chinese. What is clear is that the Chinese space programme is more willing than ever to cooperate. With the signing of the UN agreement to host foreign experiments and eventually astronauts on their space station, the Chinese are opening up. It is of course hard to imagine Russia and in particular ESA abandoning Nasa altogether, but it is not inconceivable. In the aftermath of 2008â€™s credit crunch, Nasa pulled out of a number of joint missions with Europe, including robotic Mars exploration and observatories. This left ESA floundering for new partners, or frantically rescoping its missions. Increasingly, China will play a role in the international exploration of space, and although it is early days they have so far they have proved to be highly reliable. A seismic shift in space power is taking place. Europe could pivot either way or balance in the middle. Although most still talk about China â€œbecomingâ€ a space superpower, it is likely that history will record the tipping point as 25 June this year, when a giant rocket split the sky amid the cheers of more than 20, 000 tourists.",0
"442","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/05/john-legend-adam-foss-prosecutor-teenagers-prison","Jamiles Lartey","Adam Foss doesnâ€™t look like your average prosecutor. He wears his hair in long dreadlocks that flow down to his ankles, and beaded bracelets ornate his wrists. He spent eight years as an assistant district attorney in Boston, but rather than focusing on high conviction rates or projecting a â€œtough on crimeâ€ attitude, he has been far more interested in alternatives to incarceration, and on keeping juvenile offenders out of prison. Fossâ€™s efforts might have ended there, making tweaks on the fringes of a flawed system, but in 2015, he met singer John Legend, who is no stranger to activism. Now the two want to change the way prosecutors nationwide think about their job, and to recruit them into the war against mass incarceration. â€œWe are sending in droves our young men into a system that erases them from public view and public consideration,â€ Legend told the Guardian. â€œThe only way we are going to slow that down is if we focus on holistic criminal justice reform and so much of that happens in the prosecutorâ€™s office. â€ The singer and songwriter spent much of last year on a tour of prisons around the country, visiting nine of them and sometimes performing for inmates. Through his organization Free America, Legend has been trying to bring attention to the over two million Americans in prison in order to change what he calls the â€œmisguidedâ€ criminal justice policies leading to America having the largest prison population in the world. Legend said he wasnâ€™t surprised by much of what he saw in the prisons, but was definitely disturbed. â€œYou begin to realize how much trauma and pain and abuse [the inmates] have been victims of themselves before they got to prison, and since theyâ€™ve been in prison. And you realize that itâ€™s just a cycle that keeps repeating. â€ When Legendâ€™s Free America hosted a gathering for progressive prosecutors in 2015, Foss was there, and it was there his vision for a new organization, now named Prosecutor Integrity was born. Foss wants to use the platform not just to apply political pressure, but to train the nationâ€™s prosecutors, especially young ones, on how to rethink the application of justice. â€œWeâ€™re always poking at the prisons and sentencing laws and police practices â€” and all of those things are important and need to be addressed, but the one lever that hasnâ€™t really been addressed and will push everything over the edge is this one,â€ Foss said. Prosecutors in the US wield unrivaled influence over the incarceration of alleged criminals. They alone choose what to charge, what deals to make and in all but a few jurisdictions, these decisions are not subject to any oversight or guidelines beyond the elections that put them into office. And because plea bargains are carried out away from the public eye, voters often have very few insights into how those offices work â€” at least until something goes wrong. In the words of Angela J Davis, a law professor at American University: â€œThe unchecked discretion of prosecutors is extraordinary, and the mechanisms of accountability we have donâ€™t work. â€ Foss, who was born in Colombia and adopted by a Boston family, left the Suffolk County DAâ€™s office in March to focus on his new PI organization . But while he was there, Foss tried to address that accountability gap with his own creative solutions. â€œWhat I was trying to do is look at each individual defendant as a case study. My first inclination was: â€˜Can I keep you out of the criminal justice system all together?â€™ And if I couldnâ€™t do that, how could I make it work both for you and for the the victim, the community and me?â€ In most large jurisdictions like Suffolk County, which encompasses the city of Boston, district attorneys have dozens or even hundreds of assistant DAs (ADAs) who handle the day to day details and decisions around cases. The DA himself may set priorities and policies for their staff to follow, but ADAs often have some latitude to affect justice however they see fit. These are the people Foss, Legend and Prosecutor Integrity want to reach and train to think more creatively about justice and the impacts of their decisions. In a TEDx talk Foss delivered in March, he describes a case from early in his career as an ADA involving an black man he calls â€œChristopherâ€ arrested for stealing 25 laptops from a Best Buy and selling them on the internet. Foss explained he decided not to charge the teenager because he â€œdidnâ€™t think branding him a felon for the rest of his life was the right answer. â€œWith a criminal record and without a job, Christopher would be unable to find employment, education or stable housing. Without those protective factors in his life, Christopher would be more likely to commit further, more serious crime,â€ Foss said. â€œIt is a terrible public safety outcome for the rest of us. â€ Instead, Foss helped him recover most the sold computers, and come up with a plan to pay for the ones they couldnâ€™t recover. He did community service and wrote about the impact of his actions. Six years later, Foss said, he encountered the young man again, and learned he had graduated from college and went on to become a manager at a Boston bank â€œand making a lot more money than meâ€ Foss quipped. Foss doesnâ€™t think his approach is particularly novel, either. â€œIâ€™m not this person thatâ€™s come up with this crazy idea â€” this is what weâ€™re supposed to be doing,â€ Foss said. Largely thanks to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, the wind is now at Fossâ€™s back. Enraged over prosecutor decisions in the police shooting deaths of Laquan McDonald and Tamir Rice, a popular groundswell led by activists pushed district attorneys out of office in Chicago and Cleveland during elections in March. â€œThese police killings of unarmed people is whatâ€™s making people pay attention to prosecutors, but in reality what theyâ€™re doing on a day to day basis and for so long is prosecuting ordinary citizens in ways that produce all kinds of injustices,â€ Davis said. Davis wrote the book Arbitrary Justice about the unilateral power of prosecutors nearly a decade ago and she is encouraged to see public attention shifting, but worries that the big city changeovers earlier this year speak more to a reactiveness over police killings than a popular movement committed to changing the day to day behavior of DAs. â€œEvery single one of those deaths last year was a tragedy,â€ Foss said, referring to those shot by police forces. â€œBut if you think about the number of lives that are ruined by prosecutors, itâ€™s some exponent of the number of people killed by police and we donâ€™t get angry about that. â€ According to Fordham law professor and researcher John Pfaff, prosecutors represent â€œa great untapped resourceâ€ for slowing prison admissions, and itâ€™s not just theory. Pfaff said it can be readily demonstrated at work in New York and New Jersey, two states that have been decarcerating steadily for more than 15 years. Since 2000, the two states have each decreased their prison populations by nearly 25% according to Department of Justice data. They are two of only three states, the other being California, to see drops in incarceration over that span. By comparison, 45 states have actually increased their prison rolls over that time. The rise in incarceration started â€œas the states were adopting tougher sentencing lawsâ€ Pfaff said. â€œLots of other states saw decreases in crime, and didnâ€™t stop incarcerating. Itâ€™s clearly a decision on the part of DAs. â€ The biggest challenge Foss is likely to face, beyond the inertia of the status quo, is fear. Voters have for decades stocked their districts with prosecutors mainly because of it: the fear that criminals are out to hurt them, and the belief that locking them in cages is the only way to keep their communities safe. If new prosecutors come into office on a platform of compassion and diversion, how does the public react to what Foss calls â€œthe â€ scenario where a diverted defendant commits a crime, especially a heinous or one? â€œThe truth is, the happens every day in jail and yet no one says we should stop sending people to jail,â€ Foss said. Indeed, 95% of all inmates will leave prison at some point, allegedly rehabilitated, and some percentage of them, as many as 75% according to figures from the National Institute of Justice, will be arrested again. â€œIâ€™ll give you this: what Iâ€™m trying to do is different,â€ Foss said. â€œBut is it any more dangerous than something we already know doesnâ€™t work?â€",0
"443","https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/dec/09/picasso-and-rivera-conversations-across-time-cubism-lacma","Jordan Riefe","Although they are both credited with inventing cubism, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque spent most of their lives arguing over top billing. Henri Matisse, who gave cubism its name when he derided Braque as a painter of â€œlittle cubesâ€ feuded with Picasso from the day they were introduced by Gertrude Stein in 1906. For a long time, museums have mounted shows pairing Picasso with both artists, and many others, mainly because his name sells tickets, but also because of his ability to absorb new ideas and make them his own. Another of Picassoâ€™s frenemies, Diego Rivera, shares top billing on Lacmaâ€™s winter show, Picasso and Rivera: Conversations Across Time, paralleling the European modern master with Mexicoâ€™s most revered muralist. by Lacma CEO Michael Govan and Diana Magaloni, deputy director and director of the museumâ€™s program for the art of the ancient Americas, the new show features more than 100 paintings and prints by both artists, as well as Iberian, and Aztec objects illustrating separate pursuits of modernism first through cubism, followed by a return to the classics. Born only five years apart, Picasso and Rivera demonstrated prodigious talent from an early age. After only eight months at Spainâ€™s most prestigious San Fernando Royal Academy, Picasso protested the rigidity of instruction by dropping out and moving to Paris. Rivera enrolled at the same school in 1907 and also moved to Paris in subsequent years, but it wasnâ€™t until early 1914 that the two artists met and formed a fast friendship based on overlapping esthetic values and a common tongue. â€œRivera says, â€˜Picasso was painting The Poet and I came back and painted The Sailor.â€™ Then the story goes around again and he says, â€˜Picasso complimented my Sailor at lunch but I see he has seven paintings.â€™ So (itâ€™s clear) theyâ€™re working together,â€ Magaloni concludes after reading Riveraâ€™s letters. A falling out occurred in August 1915, when Rivera accused Picasso of borrowing a technique for his composition Man Seated in Shrubbery that the former had used in his painting Zapatista Landscape. â€œHe did steal, because he stole from everyone. Picasso had friendships and fallings out all the time, as all those artists did,â€ Govan says of the dispute. â€œThe operating assumption is Rivera is five years younger, Riveraâ€™s the follower. Picassoâ€™s the inventor and leader. So this is just a twist on that story. â€ Upon completion, Picassoâ€™s painting was given a new title, Seated Man, after the artist painted over much of the work that used Riveraâ€™s technique. Rivera was later ostracized by the cubists following an argument with poet Pierre Reverdy at a dinner hosted by the artistâ€™s dealer, Leonce Rosenberg, who also represented Picasso. Correspondence between Rivera and Picasso ended, but parallels in their work persisted even after Rivera returned to Mexico in 1921. Following the turmoil of the Mexican revolution on one side of the Atlantic and the first world war on the other, artists became less concerned with forging new paths, following what Jean Cocteau called le rappel a lâ€™ordre (a return to order). â€œWhat holds it together when everythingâ€™s broken? Your traditions,â€ is how Magaloni explains the esthetic shift of the time. In the case of Picasso, he had been exploring ancient art in modernist works as early as his 1906 referencing an Iberian sculpture, Man Attacked by a Lion. After the war he again reverted to the classics with paintings such as 1923â€™s Woman in Blue Veil, a Greek figure in a typical mourning veil, commenting on the warâ€™s destructive impact on Europe. The Minotaur became a fixture in a series of etchings made from known as the Vollard Suite, and in the same period he illustrated an edition of Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses. â€œThereâ€™s still a lot of rhetoric about modernism and throwing away the past that we use in art history and popular culture,â€ says Govan. â€œBut so much of Picassoâ€™s career is looking at classical art and ancient themes. The idea is to burst the cliches of modernity. â€ Rivera did exactly that by turning to indigenous works to comment on his homelandâ€™s emergence in the modern age, and to promote inspired by leftist ideas of the era. Indigenous figures became a hallmark of paintings such as Flower Day (1925) and Fridaâ€™s Friend (1931) while the Aztec goddess of the Earth, Coatlicue, emerged as a recurring figure in his later murals. Based on a tall, monolith, Coatlicue turns up as part of the machinery in an auto factory in 1933â€™s Detroit Industry. In 1939â€™s Pan American Unity: The Marriage of the Artistic Expression of the North and South of this Continent, Coatlicue is surrounded by Riveraâ€™s wife, Frida Kahlo, peasants and the Founding Fathers, as well as Hitler and Stalin. No doubt Riveraâ€™s murals were an inspiration for Picassoâ€™s epic canvas, Guernica, a nightmarish response to the 1937 bombing of the Basque town by Nazis. â€œYou know heâ€™s looking at Mexican muralists,â€ offers Govan. â€œSo when he has to do something political, heâ€™s drawing on that notion. â€ While classic Greek and Roman works have long been an influence on western art, indigenous American art was new terrain for modernism. Although the pairing of Picasso and Rivera is generally considered one of mentor and mentee, the new show demonstrates that the truth is hardly that simple. â€œWhat he did was help the lopsidedness of our interest in ancient classical Greece or Rome versus ancient â€ says Govan about Riveraâ€™s often overlooked contribution to the equation. â€œI think there is bias. I wonâ€™t call it racism, but itâ€™s a strong bias. â€ Lacma means to help further correct that bias next year with Pacific Standard Time: which will focus on Latino and Latin American art in concurrent shows among more than 70 museums and art institutions throughout southern California. â€œWeâ€™re in California, and Latin America and Asia feel closer. Itâ€™s a flatter playing field,â€ Govan says about the museumâ€™s mission. â€œI think part of the point of this museum is to rebalance and keep rethinking these things. â€ Picasso and Rivera: Conversations Across Time â€” Los Angeles County Museum of Art, through 7 May 2017.",0
"444","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/11/nfl-round-up-green-bay-packers",NA,"Matthew Stafford took advantage of one last chance Sunday and Matt Prater redeemed himself with a field goal with eight seconds left to give the Detroit Lions a victory at Indianapolis. Prater missed an extra point wide right with 4:04 left in the season opener, a miscue that nearly cost the Lions. Detroit won for only the second time in Indy, and it came just 37 seconds after it looked like Andrew Luck had rallied the Colts for an improbable victory. It just wasnâ€™t enough to avoid Indyâ€™s third straight opening day loss in a wild finish. After Praterâ€™s miss, Luck drove the Colts 75 yards and hooked up with Jack Doyle on a TD pass with 37 seconds left. Adam Vinatieriâ€™s extra point gave the Colts a lead. This time, Stafford connected with receivers who took advantage of their speed against Indyâ€™s thin secondary. He quickly got the Lions into position for Prater to atone for the earlier miss. Stafford was 31 of 39 for 340 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions. New York Giants Dallas Cowboys, Eli Manning threw for three touchdowns, including the score to Victor Cruz in his first game in nearly two years, and the New York Giants beat the Dallas Cowboys. The Giants won the debut of coach Ben McAdoo after 12 years and two Super Bowl titles under Tom Coughlin while spoiling the first game for Dallasâ€™ Dak Prescott and Ezekiel Elliott. Because of Tony Romoâ€™s back injury, Prescott and Elliott were the first rookie back combo to start an opener for the Cowboys since Roger Staubach and Calvin Hill in 1969. The game ended with Dallas in position for a roughly field goal, but Terrance Williams didnâ€™t get out of bounds after a catch and the clock ran out. Dan Bailey had four field goals, including two from more than 50 yards. Cruz, who missed most of 2014 with a knee injury and all of last season with a bad calf, broke free in the end zone for a TD with six minutes remaining, prompting his trademark salsa dance. Randy Bullock, kicking because of Josh Brownâ€™s suspension, made the extra point for the lead after an earlier missed PAT. New York beat Dallas in an opener for the first time in nine tries. Hobbled by an ankle injury, Russell Wilson pulled off another comeback, throwing a touchdown pass to Doug Baldwin with 31 seconds left. The expected contenders in the NFC looked flawed offensively and buckled defensively in the fourth quarter, giving up an touchdown drive to Ryan Tannehill that gave the Dolphins a lead with 4:08 remaining. Thatâ€™s when Wilson went to work, playing on a right ankle that twisted badly in the third quarter as he was sacked by Ndamukong Suh. Seattle converted early in the drive on a run by Christine Michael, but the big play was Wilson finding Baldwin for 22 yards on a crossing route on near midfield. Wilson hit Baldwin in the corner of the end zone to give Seattle the lead. The extra point was partially blocked by Miamiâ€™s Jason Jones, but it didnâ€™t matter. Aaron Rodgers threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Green Bay Packers to a victory against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the teamsâ€™ season. Rodgers looked every bit like, well, a league MVP. He extended plays with his feet, escaped sacks and had precision accuracy all over the field. He completed 20 of 34 passes for 199 yards, with TD passes to Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams. He was sacked once for no yards and didnâ€™t turn it over. He helped the Packers win their second opener in the last five years. This one came on a sweltering, day that left some players cramping and others completely exhausted. Rodgers had no issues with the heat. More importantly for the Packers: neither did Nelson, who played his first game in more than a year. Nelson tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the 2015 preseason and missed the entire regular season. The injury significantly impacted Rodgers, who lost his best deep threat, and the offense, which fell to 23rd in the league and tied for 25th in passing. Nelson finished with six receptions for 32 yards, including a TD in the second quarter. Alex Smith dived for a touchdown on the first possession of overtime, completing the Kansas City Chiefsâ€™ frantic rally from a deficit to beat the San Diego Chargers . Smith threw for 363 yards and two touchdowns, the second a fade to Jeremy Maclin with just over nine minutes left in the fourth quarter that trimmed the Chiefsâ€™ deficit to . Cairo Santos kicked a field goal a few minutes later, and after forcing a Spencer Ware finished off a drive with a touchdown plunge to knot it at 27. Kansas City needed 10 plays to march 75 yards in overtime, and Smith finished off one of the biggest comebacks in franchise history with his keeper from the line on . Carson Wentz had 278 yards passing and two touchdowns in a stellar NFL debut and the Philadelphia Eagles beat Robert Griffin III and the Cleveland Browns. Promoted from No3 quarterback to starter just eight days ago, the No2 overall pick from North Dakota State looked like a franchise player. Wentz played football despite missing the last three preseason games with injured ribs. He finished 22 of 37 with a 101. 0 passer rating. A new quarterback (Griffin) and new coach (Hue Jackson) couldnâ€™t help the Browns ( ) avoid losing their opener for the 12th straight season. Wentz threw a TD pass to Jordan Matthews on the opening drive and tossed a perfect TD pass down the right side to Nelson Agholor for a lead in the third quarter. Wentz was slated to be inactive until the Eagles traded Sam Bradford to Minnesota earlier this month. He leapfrogged backup Chase Daniel on the depth chart, a bold move by rookie coach Doug Pederson that paid off in week one. Mike Nugent kicked a field goal with 54 seconds left, lifting the Cincinnati Bengals to a victory over the New York Jets. Andy Dalton threw for 366 yards and a touchdown to AJ Green, who caught 12 passes for 180 yards to help the Bengals beat the Jets for the first time in 10 meetings in New Jersey. Josh Shaw sealed the victory with an interception of Ryan Fitzpatrick in the closing seconds, helping Cincinnati improve to in openers under coach Marvin Lewis. The Bengals won despite Dalton being sacked a seven times, including 2. 5 by Leonard Williams and two by Steve McLendon. Nick Folk kicked a field goal with 3:23 remaining, but Dalton marched the Bengals downfield for the winning drive. The first missed extra point in Folkâ€™s career and a blocked attempt came back to haunt the Jets. The Baltimore Ravens used a touchdown pass by Joe Flacco, two field goals and a throwback defensive performance to beat the Buffalo Bills. Against former defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, now Buffaloâ€™s head coach, the Ravens limited the Bills to 160 yards and sacked former Tyrod Taylor twice. Thatâ€™s how Baltimore played defense under Ryan from and thatâ€™s how they won the 2012 Super Bowl. Returning from a knee injury that ended his season last November, Flacco went 23 for 34 for 258 yards, including a touchdown pass to newcomer Mike Wallace in the second quarter that put the Ravens ahead for good. That, plus field goals of 50 and 37 yards by Justin Tucker, was enough for Baltimoreâ€™s first victory since 2012. David Carr hit Seth Roberts for a touchdown with 47 seconds left, then connected with Michael Crabtree on a conversion, and the Oakland Raiders pulled out a victory over the New Orleans Saints. The Raiders had to overcome a deficit and a performance by Drew Brees. They also had to sweat out rookie kicker Wil Lutzâ€™s last second field goal attempt from 61 yards, which narrowly missed wide left as the Superdome crowd briefly erupted before realizing the kick was no good. Brees eclipsed 400 yards passing for the 14th time in his career, tying Peyton Manning for the most such performances in NFL history. Carr finished with 319 yards and one touchdown passing. Jalen Richard ran 75 yards on his first NFL carry, and Amari Cooper caught Carrâ€™s pass for a conversion to briefly tie the game at 27 in the middle of the fourth quarter. Brock Osweiler threw for 231 yards and two touchdowns in his debut with Houston to lead the Texans and their revamped offense to a win over the Chicago Bears. Osweiler, who signed to a $72m contract from Denver in the offseason, was helped by an offense filled with playmakers. He completed passes to eight different receivers, led by rookie pick Will Fuller, who became the first player in franchise history to have 100 yards receiving in a debut with 107 and a touchdown. DeAndre Hopkins added 54 yards and a score and running back Lamar Miller had 106 yards rushing in his first game with the Texans. Osweilerâ€™s day started with a hiccup when he threw an interception on the first drive, but soon got going and looked comfortable after that. Jameis Winston bounced back from an early interception to throw four touchdown passes, and Tampa Bay claimed a winning record for the first since 2012 by opening the season with a victory over the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. Winston began his second year as a pro by going 23 of 33 for 281 yards, using just about every weapon at his disposal in the matchup between NFC South rivals. He hooked up with receiver Mike Evans, running back Charles Sims III and tight ends Austin and Brandon Myers on scoring plays. The Falcons grabbed a lead late in the first quarter after Winstonâ€™s pass for Vincent Jackson was picked off by Desmond Trufant, who returned it 13 yards to the Tampa Bay 9. There was a between the quarterback and receiver, as Jackson broke outside while Winstonâ€™s threw to the inside. But Winston shook off that miscue, leading the Buccaneers on a that culminated with a TD pass to Myers. Eric Kendricks returned an interception 77 yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter and Danielle Hunter scored a TD off a fumble return and the Minnesota Vikings beat the Tennessee Titans. The Vikings wound up forcing three turnovers in the span of just under seven minutes and also had two sacks. The defending NFC North champs needed the help from their defense in scoring 25 straight points after being shut out in the first half and Adrian Peterson, the NFLâ€™s 2015 rushing leader, being smothered. Minnesota coach Mike Zimmer did his best to hide his starter at quarterback after the Vikings lost Teddy Bridgewater to a major knee injury, and after they traded their 2017 draft pick to Philadelphia for Sam Bradford.",0
"445","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/new-york-first-documented-zika-sex-case",NA,"A New York City woman infected her male partner with the Zika virus through sex, the first time transmission of the germ has been documented. Zika is usually spread by mosquitoes, though health officials have known for some time that men can spread it through sex. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the case on Friday and updated its advice for pregnant women. The CDC now advises such women to use protection if their partner has traveled to a region, whether the partner is a man or a woman. The Zika virus causes only a mild illness, at worst, in most people. But infection during pregnancy can lead to severe birth defects for the fetus. The New York woman was not pregnant. While this is the first documented case of a woman spreading Zika through sex, health experts say it is not surprising because most diseases that can be spread through sex can be spread by both men and women. It has probably been happening throughout the recent Zika outbreaks in Brazil, Latin America and elsewhere, though experts say it is probably not very common. On the day the New York woman returned from a trip to a country, she had vaginal sex with her partner without a condom, health officials were told. She went to her doctor three days after her return, after developing common Zika symptoms such as fever, fatigue, rash and back pain. Tests showed Zika infection. Seven days after they had sex, her male partner developed similar symptoms. Two days later, he went to the same doctor. The doctor tested him even though he hadnâ€™t traveled from a Zika outbreak area and no cases of transmission had been reported. He tested positive for Zika. Both patients are in their 20s, but no other details about them were released, including where the woman traveled or when the infection started. Both have recovered, a CDC official said. The woman began menstruating the day after they had sex. Health officials say she may have spread the virus through vaginal fluid or menstrual blood. The primary concern about Zika infection is the threat to pregnancies, and health officials have issued cautions to pregnant women who have a male sex partner who may have been infected. The CDC has now altered its advice slightly, to account for lesbian couples that include a pregnant woman. The CDC is now recommending that â€œbarrier methodsâ€ be used by all pregnant women who have a sex partner who lives in or travels to a Zika outbreak area. No sexual transmission had been reported to date. Eleven countries, including the US, have reported cases of apparent sexual transmission of Zika virus from one person to another, according to the World Health Organization. At least 14 were people who are believed to have caught it from sex with travelers, among the more than 1, 300 people in the 50 states and the District of Columbia who have been found to have Zika. The rest caught the virus while traveling to Latin America, the Caribbean or other outbreak areas. Health officials say all or most of those travelers were probably infected through mosquito bites in the countries they were visiting. There have been no reports of mosquitoes spreading Zika in the continental US so far. Other research has hinted at the possibility of females spreading the virus through sex. In a study published last month, a team led by researchers at the University of Wisconsin detected Zika virus in the vaginal fluid of rhesus macaque monkeys. It was found for up to seven days after the monkeys were infected. And there was one report of Zika detected in the vaginal fluid of a woman in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, a CDC official said. Some experts said the case isnâ€™t surprising. Sexually transmitted diseases that spread from men to women also spread from women to men, said Dr John M Douglas Jr, a former CDC expert on sexually transmitted diseases who now oversees a local health department in Colorado. transmission is considered far more likely than the other way around, experts said. One reason is that Zika virus has been found to linger in semen for more than two months, but is thought to stay in vaginal fluid no more than two weeks, said Dr John T Brooks, a CDC expert on sexually transmitted diseases who is part of the agencyâ€™s Zika response team. The case probably does not complicate efforts to fight the virus or show an important additional pathway for transmission, Brooks said, because transmission is relatively difficult. In the New York case, for example, several factors lined up to allow the disease to spread. The couple had sex just before the woman developed symptoms, a time when the amount of virus in her body may have been particularly high. They had sex just before her period started, so there may have been a small amount of early bleeding. And the man was uncircumcised, and uncircumcised men are considered at higher risk of catching sexually transmitted diseases.",0
"446","https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/01/us-military-syria-civilian-death-bombing-manbij","Spencer Ackerman","The US military has admitted culpability for killing approximately two dozen civilians in a July airstrike outside the Syrian city of Manbij, then the scene of fierce fighting with Islamic State militants. By the Pentagonâ€™s account, the strike, which hit the Syrian village of Tokhar near Manbij, represents the single worst incidence of civilian casualties in the entire US war against Isis. But human rights monitors believe the US military is still undercounting the death toll, which is substantially lower than the ranges those monitors have compiled. The Syrian Network for Human Rights has listed, mostly by name, 98 men, women and children dead from the July airstrike. The monitor Airwars, based in the UK, assesses civilian deaths in the strike to range between 73 and 203. In a statement on Thursday, US central command (Centcom) said that an internal investigation had concluded that â€œup to 24â€ civilians died from the bombing. Key details of the incident remain unclear: the attack at Tokhar, near Manbij, occurred in the early morning hours of 19 July, local time. Centcom listed the date of the strike as 18 July, while saying that a different 19 July strike allegation, this one near Aleppo, did not in fact happen. But it had previously acknowledged that the airstrike in question occurred. Centcom said the civilian deaths resulted from Isis â€œinterspers[ing]â€ civilians with its fighters at an area identified as a staging ground for a â€œcounterattackâ€ against US and proxy forces. At the time, the two sides had been locked in weeks of fierce fighting for control of Manbij, a waypoint for Isis to exfiltrate terrorists through Turkey, and â€” for the US coalition â€” the last obstacle southward to Isisâ€™ Syrian capital of Raqqa. The US said the airstrike targeted the area and â€œinadvertentlyâ€ killed the alongside nearly 100 Isis militants. â€œUnknown to Coalition planners, civilians were moving around within the military staging area, even as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days,â€ Centcom said in its statement. After various investigations into allegations of casualties, Centcom now believes that the US has inadvertently killed 173 people to date in a war that has entered its third year. But monitoring groups say that the US has systematically undercounted the civilian death toll of the war. â€œOur own research indicates at least 330 civilians died in these same events. Even when [Centcom] confirmed cases, there appears to be on these incidents,â€ said Airwarsâ€™ Chris Woods. Woods said he was â€œvery pleasedâ€ that Centcom acknowledged its role in the strike, though he noted the confusion in dates as to when the strike occurred. But he considered the variance in casualty figures alarming. â€œHow can we only have 24 killed by the coalition, when we have such substantial reporting of civilian casualties that day?â€ said Woods.",0
"447","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/31/email-attack-democrats-war-another-name","John Naughton","Last month, it was discovered that the computer networks of the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) had been penetrated by two sets of intruders, who appear to have been unaware of one anotherâ€™s activities. The hackers seem to have been able to do whatever they liked, including accessing the DNCâ€™s email servers. As a result, some (perhaps most) DNC emails found their way into the public domain via a number of routes, including WikiLeaks. The leaked emails were embarrassing for the DNC in two ways: first, because they revealed that some of its staff had been trying to undermine senator Bernie Sanders, the radical politician who was challenging Hillary Clinton for the partyâ€™s nomination and second, because they revealed the lines of argument with which Democrats were intending to undermine Donald Trump when the election proper got under way. On 24 July, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, announced her resignation. The leaks caused outrage among Sandersâ€™s supporters, who made their dissatisfaction abundantly clear on the opening day of a convention that was supposed to unanimously confirm Clinton as the partyâ€™s nomination for the presidency. So the hacking and the associated leaks had not only unhorsed the head of one of Americaâ€™s two political parties but also disrupted Clintonâ€™s nominating convention. Some hack, eh? Needless to say, itâ€™s been dubbed Watergate 2. 0, in memory of the burglary of the DNC HQ in June 1972 by people working for Richard Nixonâ€™s campaign team. And now, just as in 1972, the key questions are: who were the burglars? And what were their motives? A number of cybersecurity firms investigated the DNC hacks and concluded that the culprits were two agencies of the Russian government, one the FSB (successor to the KGB) the other Russiaâ€™s military intelligence agency, the GRU. A clinching piece of evidence linking the hack to the Russians was the existence of an internet address in the DNC malware that had also been found in a piece of malware used in a Russian attack on the German parliamentâ€™s servers. So it seems pretty clear that Putinâ€™s lot were the burglars. But what were their motives? Here the conspiracy theories begin. As ever, chronology rules. On 15 June, the DNC strategy for handling Trump was leaked to the Smoking Gun, a website that specialises in publishing embarrassing legal documents, arrest records and police mugshots. On 17 June, WikiLeaks announced that it had mysteriously acquired an 88GB cache of documents that it had encrypted for â€œinsuranceâ€ purposes. On 13 July, selected DNC emails were leaked to the Hill, a politics website. The Republican convention opened on 18 July, with delegates mocking the DNCâ€™s plans for dealing with Trump. Then, on 23 July, WikiLeaks released nearly 20, 000 DNC emails, some of them embarrassing for Clinton because of what they reveal about DNC official views of Sanders. The next day, Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned and the day after that the Democratic convention opened, with Sandersâ€™s supporters still furious about the DNCâ€™s treatment of their hero. A key question in any criminal investigation is: who benefits? Looking at the above chronology, the answer is clear: Donald Trump. Which then leads to a second question: why would agencies of the Russian government wish to undermine Clinton and benefit her opponent? Here the conspiracy theories move up a gear. Trump has boasted of his admiration for Putin as a â€œstrongâ€ leader with whom he can do business. His admiration has been reciprocated by Putin. Trump has also made clear his disdain for Nato as an organisation that enables European nations to have security without paying their fair share of its costs. So if he were president and Putin made aggressive moves against the Baltic states, would he support a strong Nato response? Who knows? But if you were in Putinâ€™s shoes, youâ€™d regard Trump as clearly preferable to Clinton, who is an American hawk. All of this is pure speculation. What is more interesting about the DNC hack, as Professor Thomas Rid of Kingâ€™s College, London points out in his thoughtful analysis of the saga, is that it represents a significant shift in Russian military doctrine. They call it â€œnew generation warfareâ€ a mindset that significantly expands the definition of a military target and what qualify as military tactics. Itâ€™s an approach to conflict thatâ€™s â€œdesigned to manipulate the adversaryâ€™s picture of reality, misinform it, and eventually interfere with the process of individuals, organisations, governments and societiesâ€. Subtle interference in western elections fits neatly into that mindset. Welcome to the future.",0
"448","https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/08/ed-sheeran-sued-photograph-matt-cardle-amazing","Nigel M Smith","Ed Sheeranâ€™s 2014 summer hit Photograph is at the center of a new $20m lawsuit alleging that the â€™s ballad copies a song released by a winner of The X Factor. Attorney Richard Busch, who recently triumphed on behalf of Marvin Gayeâ€™s family over the hit Blurred Lines, is representing the songwriters Martin Harrington and Thomas Leonard. They say Sheeranâ€™s Photograph â€œ â€ copies their 2009 song Amazing. That song was released as the third single by Matt Cardle, winner of the 2010 season of The X Factor. Harrington and Leonard have also written songs for Kylie Minogue and Emma Bunton. Cardle is not a party to the lawsuit. Amazing got to No 84 in the UK, though it has generated more than 1m video plays on YouTube. However, the singleâ€™s success pales in comparison with that of Photograph, which as of 1 June had sold more than 3. 5m copies, according to the lawsuit. Sheeranâ€™s song has more than 208m plays on YouTube, and is largely credited for elevating his profile to superstar status. Most recently, it was licensed for the romantic drama Me Before You. Harrington and Leonard claim in their lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in a Los Angeles federal court, that the similarities between the two songs are evident even to the untrained listener. â€œThe chorus sections of Amazing and the infringing Photograph share 39 identical notes â€” meaning the notes are identical in pitch, rhythmic duration, and placement in the measure,â€ the lawsuit reads. â€œThe songsâ€™ similarities reach the very essence of the work,â€ it states. â€œThe similarities go beyond substantial, which is itself sufficient to establish copyright infringement, and are in fact striking. The similarity of words, vocal style, vocal melody, melody, and rhythm are clear indicators, among other things, that Photograph copies Amazing. â€ Harrington and Leonard allege in the lawsuit that they sought to resolve their copyright claims privately before going to court. Sheeran had been accused of lifting from Amazing by some on social media since the song started making waves. Ã‰ire Creative, a creative design, animation and editing studio, went so far as to publish a YouTube video in an effort to prove the songsâ€™ similarities. The stakes for Sheeran could be high should the judge find against him. Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams, the composers of Blurred Lines, were required to pay $7. 2m. Though this was reduced on appeal, the Marvin Gaye estate now receives 50% of publishing and songwriting revenues from the song. Sheeranâ€™s representatives declined to comment.",0

He was 77. Thierry Fremaux, the director of the Cannes film festival, tweeted the news on Saturday, saying: â€œMichael Cimino has died, in peace, surrounded by friends and the two women who loved him. We loved him too. â€ Cimino directed eight films, starting in 1974 with the highly rated Clint Eastwood and Jeff crime movie Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, for which he also wrote the screenplay. The Deer Hunter, a harrowing story of friends from working class Pennsylvania played by Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken, in which a young Meryl Streep also appears and her then fiancÃ© John Cazale takes his final role, followed in 1978. The film was a critical and commercial success. On its in 2014, Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw saluted The Deer Hunterâ€™s â€œcombination of sulphurous imagery, disillusion and patriotic melancholyâ€. â€œA simple, fact slaps you in the face after watching The Deer Hunter,â€ Bradshaw wrote. â€œVietnam was different to Iraq and Afghanistan in one vital respect: the soldiers were drafted. They had no choice. The idea of sacrifice permeates everything, along with the cruelty and horror. This is Ciminoâ€™s masterpiece. â€ Heavenâ€™s Gate (1980) starring Walken and Kris Kristofferson and loosely based on the Wyoming Johnson County war of was a critical and commercial failure which hastened the demise of the United Artists studio and coloured the rest of Ciminoâ€™s career. The film has since undergone something of a critical rehabilitation. In 2013, Bradshaw called it â€œcolossally ambitious and mysteriously moving, with an unhurried, unforced pace, beautifully photographed by Vilmos Zsigmondâ€ the cinematographer who died in January at the age of 85. Ciminoâ€™s other films included Desperate Hours (1990) a thriller starring Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins, and the gangster film The Sicilian (1986) which was adapted from a novel by Godfather author Mario Puzo. In 2001 he published his only novel, Big Jane, a story of the 1950s and the Korean war. Speaking to the Guardian, he said of his ups and downs in film: â€œHollywood has always been crazy. Itâ€™s controlled anarchy. But how can you loathe something that has given you so much? â€œI wouldnâ€™t have had the life Iâ€™ve had without movies. Anybody who says theyâ€™re bitter is sick in their soul. Theyâ€™ve given up. â€ On Saturday, the writer, producer and director Christopher McQuarrie, tweeted: â€œThunderbolt and Lightfoot, The Deer Hunter and yes â€¦ Heavenâ€™s Gate. Michael Cimino. May the rest of us do half as well. â€ The director William Friedkin said: â€œI wish I had paid tribute to Michael Cimino while he was alive. He was an important and masterful film maker.

"451","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/are-we-living-through-another-1930s-paul-mason","Paul Mason","Things are happening with rapidity: Brexit, the Turkish coup, Islamist massacres in France, the surrounding of Aleppo, the nomination of Donald Trump. From the USA to France to Britain, the high levels of public racism and xenophobia, reflected now in the outpourings of politicians with poll ratings, have got people asking: is it a rerun of the 1930s? On the face of it, the similarities are real. Britainâ€™s vote to leave the EU parallels its panicked decision to quit the gold standard in September 1931 â€” the first major country to quit the global economic system. Labourâ€™s incipient split mirrors the one that left the party out of power for 14 years. And of course the economic background â€” a depression and a banking crisis â€” has echoes in the present situation. But a proper study of the 1930s reveals our situation today to be better and more salvageable in many ways, although in one respect worse. Following the Wall Street crash of 1929, the economic downturn took hold in 1931, with the failure of banks on both sides of the Atlantic, the imposition of austerity measures on economies, the resort to tariffs, currency blocks and economic nationalism. The fact that elites advocated mass unemployment, as a downward pressure on wages, created the firewood overtly militarised and genocidal fascist groups lit the spark. It took just two years from Hitlerâ€™s first electoral breakthrough in 1930 for the Nazi party to score 37% in an election. Then you get the demonstration in Paris in 1934 the rising of the Asturian miners in Spain, put down by the army German rearmament beginning in 1935. The Spanish civil war starts in 1936 â€” while, in the same year, workers in both France and the US stage mass occupations of factories, and Stalin begins the great purge. It is here that the 30s take their essential shape: the surrender of democracy, the certainty of war â€” and the march to mass civilian death. For us today, the single biggest positive difference is that we start from a globalised world economy. We begin from a qualitatively more interdependent economic system, in which autarky is widely understood â€” even by politicians who would like to try it â€” as suicide. It was this realisation that forced the disoriented elites at the London and Cannes G20 conferences in 2009 and 2011 to coordinate extraordinary stimulus measures to stave off a breakdown. Those, myself included, who paced around the edges of these events declaring the action inadequate should admit â€” despite the inadequacy â€” that they acted in the right spirit. The elite rejected â€œ â€ economics of the kind that plunged the US into depression and Germany into fascism. Everywhere, that is, except Europe â€” and, even in Europe, extremism has been held at bay until now. The problem is, politically, we have in one sense gone beyond the 1930s. Force yourself to listen to the subtexts of social media: the organised hatred against black female actor Leslie Jones, the anonymous racism and misogyny, the habitual fusion of and hate. Force yourself â€” maybe just once â€” to watch what some people are watching every day: black kids murdered by US cops Syrian kids blown to pieces by Assad, or Russia or the US airforce bloggers crucified in public by Isis, the mangled bodies of French partygoers on the Nice seafront. When Francoâ€™s troops took Badajoz, and put 2, 000 of its inhabitants against the wall in the early days of the Spanish civil war, the Wehrmachtâ€™s military observer was so disgusted that he advised German troops should never be allowed to serve alongside Francoâ€™s lest they become â€œbrutalisedâ€. Today, an entire generation of humanity has been brutalised â€” whether it experiences mass slaughter, rape and torture firsthand, or whether it simply sees the pictures and hears the stories. If you read any memoir from the 30s and the war years, there is almost always a moment of realisation: what a cadaver looks like that prisoners can be shot that the Geneva conventions may be flouted. Sadly, in sheer brutality, we are past the 1930s â€” and in the struggle between governments and civilian populations the Geneva conventions do not apply. The worst thing about the present â€” and millions of people feel it â€” is the momentum towards catharsis. It is impossible to imagine everything dying back to a boring stasis. When you watch ErdoÄŸanâ€™s goons marching lifelong democratic journalists to jails where, as Amnesty International reports, beatings, torture and rape are routine, it becomes possible to imagine these things happening in other nominal democracies. On the face of it, we have two things the 1930s lacked. We have billions of educated and literate brains on the planet and we have the concept of universal and inalienable human rights. When, at the start of this unrest, I read Stephane Hesselâ€™s Indignez Vous! (Time for Outrage) â€” one of the pamphlets that inspired the Occupy protests â€” I wondered why he dwelt so long on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Hessel had been a French resistance fighter and helped write the 1948 declaration. In an address to the youth of the tent camps in 2008, he spends several long paragraphs explaining why they fought so hard for the word â€œuniversalâ€ and not â€œinternationalâ€: â€œThat is how to forestall the argument for full sovereignty that a state likes to make when it is carrying out crimes against humanity on its soil. â€ Hesselâ€™s generation understood that â€” even if it were all a figleaf for US hegemony â€” a global and universal system of human rights would leave a lasting legacy. Today, when a journalist or NGO worker stumbles on the scene of a massacre, they think â€” if they have been trained right â€” about for a court first, the sensational scoop second. So, no. This is not the 1930s with drones and trolls. We have â€” and must defend â€” a resilient global system. One glance at an uncensored social media timeline will tell you what happens if we let go of that.",0

The cars, which the government says should only be driven by Saudi men, offer women, who are banned from driving in the conservative Muslim country, an alternative to being driven to work by chauffeurs, male relatives or the shabby taxi system. apps have come under intense scrutiny from governments and regulators across the globe as they disrupt traditional taxi businesses. But Saudi Arabia courted Uber and Careem, offering state investments, to support its Vision 2030 economic reform plan. With a budget squeezed by lower oil prices, the plan aims to draw workers away from government jobs by creating 450, 000 private sector positions by 2020. Uber and Careem say they will create up to 200, 000 jobs for Saudi men in the next two years.

With the workforces of Uber and Careem easily expected to overtake the 65, 000 nationals employed by state oil giant Saudi Aramco, the kingdom has invested in both companies. Saudiâ€™s sovereign wealth fund put $3. 5 billion into Uber in June 2016 while Saudi Telecom Co announced on Dec. 18 it bought 10 percent of Careem for $100 million. â€The percentage of Careem captains who are Saudi has jumped from effectively zero to 60 percent in the last 12 months, and we aim to employ 70, 000 Saudis by end 2017,â€ said Abdulla Elyas, of Careem. SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE Women already account for around 80 percent of Uber and Careemâ€™s passengers, the companies say. â€In a country where they (women) cannot get behind the wheel we are offering both the women and the government a solution,â€ said Zeid Hreish, Uberâ€™s general manager in Saudi. A personal driver offers the most cache for and women. But as these cost as much as 3, 000 riyals (651. 47 pounds) a month, around 20 percent of the average monthly household income, women are always looking for cheaper options. Some wealthier Saudi women have never used the countryâ€™s existing taxi system because it is not seen as acceptable for them to travel in the older vehicles that are often provided. Uber and Careem offer an alternative because they require their drivers to use cars that are less than three years old. Uber works with car financing companies in Saudi Arabia to get deals to help its drivers buy newer cars. The use of the app for booking a car also allows a passenger to select a particular driver and some believe that the use of smart phone technology brings a better class of driver. There is little difference in price between a journey with Uber or Careem and a local taxi company but the industry does not feel threatened because it caters to a different market taxi hailers are usually lower income men and do not own smartphones. â€We have very little overlapping demand with Careem and Uber,â€ said an assistant manager at a limousine company, who wished not to be named. Careem is however, developing a subsidized rides program for working Saudi women with the Ministry of Labour. EVOLVING ATTITUDES The high female engagement with such apps also reflects how social attitudes are evolving in the conservative kingdom. Traditional social norms dictate local women cannot interact with men to which they are not related. However, the scenario has jumped ahead of such restrictions, aided by a zero tolerance policy for driver complaints operated by Uber and Careem. â€I am comfortable in the car with the driver because we are getting a professional service from a company where the driver will be held accountable for any complaints made against him,â€ said Alia Shayef, a banker living in Jeddah. But some riders and drivers remain uneasy about the mixing of genders. An 18 year old university student in Riyadh said that since more Saudis became Uber and Careem drivers her father has forbidden her to use those apps. A Careem driver also admitted he does not take any female riders to avoid cultural clashes and any risk of complaint. The proliferation of services has also done little to take away the yearning for women to drive. Some are concerned that it has made it even less likely that the government will ever allow women to get behind a steering wheel. In June when Uber announced the Saudi wealth fund had invested in its business some Saudi women took to Twitter to unveil their disapproval with the hashtag â€Saudi women announce Uber boycott,â€ trending within hours of the news. JOBS FOR MEN The state investment is partly aimed at bolstering the employment of local men at a time of rising unemployment. The Ministry of Transportation in November said Uber and Careem must â€limit the jobs to Saudi nationalsâ€ although legal drivers may continue to work for the companies. Working for a company such as Uber is a draw for Saudis, helping some overcome the stigma of being a driver. â€œUber is a trend and people want to follow it, and be a part of the digital revolution,â€ said Abdulelah Bassyoni, founder and managing director of digital consultancy Brain Technology. Despite this, both Careem and Uber say most drivers work alongside government jobs that they are reluctant to leave cause of the perceived security and benefits. Nasser, a Riyadh said he was working as an Uber driver to top up his government salary with extra cash. â€It is crazy to think anyone would leave their government position, it is a blessing to have it,â€ he said.

"453","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autos-selfdriving-idUSKBN14S048","Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage","Automotive suppliers and automakers are expanding alliances to develop car technology that can serve multiple automakers, as the race to put such vehicles on the road separates companies that can go it alone from those that need help sharing the financial and technical burdens. While some companies, such as Tesla Motors, General Motors and Ford Motor, are trying to develop proprietary driverless systems, a larger group of automakers appears to have decided it makes more sense to develop technology in collaboration with suppliers â€” as many other features such as brakes or cruise control already are. â€Whatâ€™s going on in the industry right now is like a hyper version of musical chairs and the music is still playing,â€ said Gill Pratt, chief executive officer of Toyota Research Institute. â€Everyone is changing partners.â€ Several suppliers notably Mobileye, Nvidia and Delphi Automotive are among the more popular technology partners in the race, with multiple alliances around the globe. â€If you want to build a truly autonomous car, this is a task for more than one player,â€ said Amnon Shashua, chief executive of Mobileye, an supplier of mapping and sensing systems. â€The technological challenges are immense,â€ Shashua told Reuters. â€I would compare it to sending a man to the moon.â€ Mobileye supplies cameras, chips and software for driver assist systems the building blocks for cars to more than two dozen manufacturers around the globe. The company was an early supplier of vision systems to Tesla, but the two companies had an acrimonious and public breakup last summer after the driver of a Tesla Model S was killed while operating his vehicle using Teslaâ€™s Autopilot system. Since the break with Tesla, Mobileye has secured two critical partnerships to develop systems: With German automaker BMW and U. S. chipmaker Intel, and with longtime supplier Delphi. The alliance involves a system that the partners plan to offer to smaller automakers that lack the resources to develop such systems on their own. It will be ready for production by 2019, said Jeff Owens, Delphiâ€™s chief technology officer, with a projected wholesale cost of about $5, 000. The alliance with BMW and Intel is expected to draw additional vehicle manufacturers and suppliers, according to Elmar Frickenstein, BMWâ€™s senior vice president for automated driving. â€We would like to create a standard system for everybody to use by 2021,â€ Frickenstein said. â€That would share the costs and speed up the process of development and adoption.â€ Eventually, BMW and its partners could offer hardware and software sets or an entire driverless system on a basis to companies ranging from Uber [UBER. UL] to Google, Frickenstein said. A blueprint for collaboration is BMWâ€™s joint ownership with Daimler AG and Volkswagen AGâ€™s ( ) Audi of Here, the mapping company acquired in late 2015 from Nokia. Since then, both Intel and Mobileye have teamed with Here to pool and share data. Chipmaker Nvidia also is ramping up its partnerships in technology and systems, this week announcing deals with Audi and Here, as well as German suppliers ZF [ZFF. UL] and Bosch [ROBG. UL]. â€Weâ€™re not looking to develop a proprietary system,â€ said Dirk Hoheisel, the member of Boschâ€™s board of management who oversees autonomous driving. â€We want to work with others to develop a standard platform and open standards for systems, especially around data and mapping.â€ While pursuing similar partnerships with suppliers, Audi sees its role as a vehicle manufacturer evolving to that of systems integrator. â€Thereâ€™s not one supplier out there who can provide the whole solution no one who knows everything, every part of whatâ€™s needed to make an autonomous car,â€ said Alejandro Vukotich, Audiâ€™s head of development for driver assistance systems. Some key components of systems cybersecurity, for instance should remain the responsibility of vehicle manufacturers, said Guillaume Devauchelle, head of innovation and scientific development at French supplier Valeo. But carmakers also will continue to rely on suppliers to provide specific technologies, he said. â€There will be a mix because itâ€™s quite a complex system (with) sensing, data fusion, artificial intelligence, connectivity, interface and so on,â€ Devauchelle said. â€Those are big blocks.â€ (In 9th paragraph, corrects cost of Delphi system to $5, 000 from $8, 000.)

"454","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-idUSKBN14T2I2","Phil Stewart","Donald Trump is finding himself caught between his desire to improve relations with Russia and fellow Republicans who are pushing for a harsher response to what American spy agencies say was the Kremlinâ€™s meddling in the U. S. presidential election. The tacit acknowledgement on Sunday by his incoming chief of staff, Reince Priebus, that Russia was behind the hacking of Democratic Party organizations suggests that Trumpâ€™s maneuvering room could be shrinking. Trump has long been dismissive of the U. S. intelligence conclusion that Russia was behind the election hacks, which Russia has denied, or was trying to help him win the November ballot, saying the intrusions could have been carried out by China or a hacker sitting on his bed. But following a report from U. S. intelligence agencies last week blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia experts say Trump will face growing calls for a stiff military, diplomatic, economic, and perhaps also covert response after his Jan. 20 inauguration. â€The new U. S. administration will need to adopt a significantly tougher line,â€ said Nile Gardiner of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington that is an influential voice in Trumpâ€™s transition team. Republicans in Congress wary of Trumpâ€™s push for detente with Putin could pressure the new president to withhold the thing the Russian leader wants most: a rapid easing of the economic sanctions imposed after Russiaâ€™s 2014 annexation of Ukraineâ€™s Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, the Russia experts said. U. S. intelligence agencies say that since the election, Russian spies have turned to hacking other individuals and organizations, including prominent in what analysts think is an effort to gain insights into future U. S. policies. Washingtonâ€™s Brookings Institution, which is headed by prominent Russia expert Strobe Talbott, â€received a big wave of attacks the day after the election,â€ but there is no reason to believe its systems have been compromised, said David Nassar, the think tankâ€™s vice president for communications. SHOWDOWN WITH CONGRESS? Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he and fellow Republican John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, would introduce legislation with stronger sanctions than the ones now in place. â€Weâ€™re going to introduce sanctions that . .. will hit them in the financial sector and the energy sector, where theyâ€™re the weakest,â€ Graham told NBC televisionâ€™s Meet the Press. Retired Marine General James Mattis, the nominee for secretary of defense who will face a Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, is expected to advocate a stronger line against Moscow than the one Trump outlined during his election campaign. That could put him at odds with Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, retired Army Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who has had warmer relations with Putinâ€™s government, and with Rex Tillerson, the nominee for secretary of state, who as CEO of ExxonMobil had extensive business ties with Russia. If Mattis does push for a tougher approach to Russia, that could empower U. S. advocates for strengthening the American military presence in Europe. That could include reinforcing U. S. troops in the Baltic states and Poland, analysts say. NATO already plans to deploy 4, 000 additional troops, planes, tanks and artillery to the three former Soviet republics in the Baltics and Poland this year. â€There is nervousness about Trump among Europeans at NATO,â€ said one European diplomat. â€Any grand bargain with Russia would fundamentally change NATOâ€™s course and threaten Europe with disunity,â€ the diplomat said. â€But we donâ€™t expect that. NATO is seeking to reassure Baltic allies, and the United States is a big part of the deterrent.â€ Some advocates of a sterner response to the Russian hacking say it should include cyber counterattacks, perhaps by leaking financial information embarrassing to some of Putinâ€™s aides and close associates. So far, the Obama administration has refrained from such action, at least publicly, for fear that it could lead to an escalating cyberwar that could threaten critical infrastructure such as financial transactions and energy transmission. TRUMP RUSSIA POLICY STILL A BLUR Although Trump has said the nation needed to â€move on to bigger and better thingsâ€ following the U. S. disclosure of alleged Russian hacking, it appears that Republican and Democratic lawmakers are unlikely to drop the issue anytime soon. McCain told NBC he wanted to create a select committee to investigate the Russian hacking, if he can convince the Senateâ€™s leaders to charge their minds. In the meantime, he said, key Senate committees, including Armed Services and Intelligence, will investigate. Experts say the close scrutiny of Russiaâ€™s actions will come just as Trumpâ€™s administration starts to craft a comprehensive strategy on the former Cold War foe. It is likely to be weeks or longer before a clear sense of Trumpâ€™s actual Russia strategy comes into view. â€Until thereâ€™s a team in place, until thereâ€™s a little more organization â€¦ I tend to think weâ€™re not going to have clear answers,â€ said Heather Conley, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Europe now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"455","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-kushner-idUSKBN14T251","Steve Holland and Emily Stephenson","U. S. Donald Trumpâ€™s Jared Kushner, will become a senior White House adviser working on trade and the Middle East, transition officials said on Monday, in a rare case of a close presidential family member taking a major job. Kushner, 35, who is married to Trumpâ€™s daughter Ivanka, is taking the post after receiving legal counsel that doing so would not violate U. S. law, transition officials said. The position, unlike Cabinet posts, does not require U. S. Senate confirmation, and Kushner will not be paid. Trump, in a statement on Monday announcing the choice, said Kushner was a â€tremendous asset and trusted advisor throughout the campaign and transition.â€ Kushner, who like Trump is a New York real estate developer, emerged as an important voice early in his â€™s presidential campaign and was involved in almost every aspect of it from personnel decisions to strategy and fundraising. Ivanka Trump, who like her husband has been a close adviser to the will not take on a role in her fatherâ€™s White House but will focus on settling her family in Washington. Kushner and his wife will undertake significant divestments of their financial portfolios as they prepare for their move to Washington from New York and face inevitable questions about a potential conflict of interest. Senior transition officials and a lawyer for Kushner laid out the arrangement in a conference call with a small group of reporters. Kushner is to work closely with incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and senior strategist Steve Bannon in advising the new president, and the officials said he would focus at least at first on trade policy and the Middle East. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has vowed to rewrite international trade deals to make them more favorable to the United States. He has also pledged to move the U. S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv, where it has been for 68 years, to Jerusalem, all but enshrining the city as Israelâ€™s capital despite international objections. â€™WE HAVE THE BETTER ARGUMENTâ€™ Jamie Gorelick, a New York lawyer who served as deputy attorney general for Democratic President Bill Clinton and helped advise Kushner, said his new post would not violate a 1967 statute. She said Congress in 1978 authorized the president to hire personnel for the White House office â€without regardâ€ to federal personnel laws like the statute and that court rulings had determined the White House was not an â€agencyâ€ under the law. â€Iâ€™m not saying that there isnâ€™t an argument on the other side, and I respect the people who have made the argument on the other side. I just think we have the better argument,â€ Gorelick said. Richard Briffault, a government ethics expert at Columbia Law School, disagreed, saying: â€Given the fact that the president is specifically mentioned, you would think that someone that is working for the president would be coveredâ€ by the law. Bill Clinton aroused controversy in 1993 when he named his wife, Hillary Clinton, to lead his healthcare reform drive. She lost the Nov. 8 election to Trump. After John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, he chose his brother Robert as attorney general. Late on Monday, a group of six Democrats on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee said they had written to the Justice Department and U. S. Office of Government Ethics asking them to review concerns about nepotism and conflicts of interest arising from Kushnerâ€™s appointment. DIVESTMENTS In order to comply with federal ethics laws and after consulting the Office of Government Ethics, Kushner will take a number of steps to divest substantial assets, Gorelick said. Kushner will resign from his positions as chief executive of the Kushner Companies and as publisher of the New York Observer newspaper and divest from any interests in the New York Observer, Thrive Capital, the 666 Fifth Avenue office building in midtown Manhattan and any foreign investments. In addition, Kushner will recuse himself from participating in matters that could have a direct effect on his remaining financial interests. Those interests include real estate in the New York area, Ivanka Trumpâ€™s interest in the new Trump hotel in Washington and the Ivanka Trump Brand fashion business, the officials said. Kushner will file a public financial disclosure form. Norman Eisen, a former ethics chief under President Barack Obama, said in an email that Kushnerâ€™s ethics and disclosure moves appeared to be a â€positive step.â€ â€I hope his takes a page from his book and does the same, as presidents have for the past four decades, by divesting into a blind trust or the equivalent,â€ Eisen said. Trump has said he would transfer control of his business to his children, but he has given no details. A planned news conference in December on the topic was canceled. Trump is expected to take questions from reporters this week. (Additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Doina Chiacu and Eric Walsh",0
"456","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-south-carolina-shooting-roof-idUSKBN14T1W3","Harriet McLeod","White supremacist Dylann Roof on Monday stood by his pledge not to testify or call any witnesses who might persuade jurors not to sentence him to death for killing nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. That leaves jurors deciding his fate to consider only the evidence offered by U. S. prosecutors, including four days of poignant testimony from more than 20 family and friends of the victims, who recounted the lives of their loved ones, ages 26 to 87, and the impact of their deaths. Roof is representing himself. The jury last month found him guilty of 33 counts of federal hate crimes resulting in death, obstruction of religion and firearms charges for the massacre during a Bible study meeting at the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. Deliberations about whether Roof should be put to death or sent to prison for life were scheduled to begin on Tuesday. U. S. District Judge Richard Gergel denied Roofâ€™s request that the judge decide his sentence rather than the jury. Earlier Monday, federal prosecutors rested their case in the penalty phase after several family members spoke about Tywanza Sanders, 26, who according to trial testimony told the gunman, â€You donâ€™t have to do thisâ€ before he was shot at least five times. Sanders was ambitious, determined and headstrong, his sister, Shirrene Goss, said. â€He was not fearful to try anything and not fearful to say what was on his mind,â€ she said. At the time of his death, the college graduate who was the youngest of the victims, had been preparing to move to Florida to study audio engineering, said his mother, Felicia Sanders, one of three survivors of the shooting. â€The hardest thing was when (the school) called to say â€™Whereâ€™s Tywanza Sanders? He didnâ€™t show up at class,â€™â€ his mother told jurors. â€And my husband had to say â€™He died, he canâ€™t come, heâ€™s no longer with us. â€™â€ Roof did not ask questions of witnesses. He seldom objected to the governmentâ€™s evidence detailing his premeditation and lack of remorse, including a racist manifesto written from his jail cell after his arrest. He told jurors in an opening statement last week that he was serving as his own lawyer to prevent their hearing details about his mental health. The lawyers who represented him during the trialâ€™s guilt phase said Roofâ€™s strategy proved he was not fit to represent himself. However, Gergel twice ruled Roof competent.

S. government launched a probe into claims the devices were vulnerable to potentially hacks that could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or cause them to fail by draining their batteries.. The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Homeland Security said that St. Judeâ€™s software update addresses some, but not all, known cyber security problems in its heart devices. The patch that Abbott began pushing out to patients on Monday addresses vulnerabilities that present the greatest risk to patients and prevent hackers from accessing the device, said FDA spokeswoman Angela Stark. â€The patch is intended to reduce the risk of unauthorized individuals exploiting the vulnerability and support patient safety,â€ she said. â€The FDA has maintained this focus on addressing patient safety first and foremost throughout its investigation.â€ A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said he had no immediate comment on the remaining problems. St. Jude spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin declined to identify specific problems, but said: â€The cybersecurity landscape is evolving. St. Jude Medical has worked with, and continues to work with, the FDA and DHS to update and improve the security of our technology.â€ MedSec Chief Executive Justine Bone said in a statement that â€a multitude of severe vulnerabilitiesâ€ were not fixed in the security update. They include the ability to issue an unauthorized command to a cardiac implant from a device other than St. Judeâ€™s Merlin@Home device, Bone said. Monday marked the first time that the FDA and DHS had confirmed that St. Jude devices were vulnerable to hacking. They said they knew of no cyber attacks on patients with the companyâ€™s cardiac implants. The FDA said that the benefits of continuing treatment outweighed cyber risks. DHS said only an attacker â€with high skillâ€ could exploit the vulnerability. They launched the probe in August after firm Muddy Waters and cyber security firm MedSec Holdings said the devices were riddled with security flaws that made them vulnerable to potentially hacks. When Muddy Waters went public with the claims, it also disclosed it was shorting St. Jude Medical, which was preparing to sell itself to Abbott. The firm said it believed that disclosure of the vulnerabilities could cause the $25 billion deal to fall apart, but Abbott last week completed its acquisition of St. Jude, one of the worldâ€™s biggest makers of implantable cardiac devices. Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said he felt the release of the software patch â€effectively vindicatesâ€ the research produced by his firm and MedSec. As St. Jude announced the security patch, it declined comment on a lawsuit it filed against Muddy Waters and MedSec in September. It accused them of perpetrating a â€willful and malicious scheme to manipulate the securities markets for their own financial windfall.â€ MedSec said St. Jude has not dropped the lawsuit. Abbott shares closed down 0. 1 percent at $40. 74. The S&P 500, by comparison, dipped 0. 3 percent. (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston",0
"458","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-backpage-idUSKBN14T1OR?il=0","Andrew Chung","The justices refused to consider reviving a lawsuit against Backpage. com filed by three young women who claimed the website facilitated their forced prostitution through classified advertisements posted in its â€escortsâ€ section. The high court let stand a lower courtâ€™s decision last year to dismiss the lawsuit because the Communications Decency Act, a 1996 law protecting free speech on the internet, shielded Backpage from liability for the content of the ads. Tech companies commonly invoke the Communications Decency Act in defending against similar lawsuits. The tech industry could have faced consequences had the Supreme Court decided to limit the scope of the statute. The women sued Backpage and several of its parent companies in Boston federal court in 2014, alleging they were â€repeatedly forced as minors to engage in illegal commercial sex transactionsâ€ in Massachusetts and Rhode Island starting at age 15 by pimps who advertised on the website. Backpage is the U. S. online classified ad service after Craigslist. The 1st U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Communications Decency Act, which prevents a website operator from being held liable as the â€publisher or speakerâ€ of its content, granted broad protections to internet publishers. Over the past two decades, the Communications Decency Act has provided an effective legal shield for the technology industry, protecting social media and sites from liability in a variety of lawsuits over unsafe products, stolen property and facilitating prostitution. But some judges have ruled that the law has been stretched too far. Robert an attorney for Backpage, said the Supreme Courtâ€™s rejection of the womenâ€™s appeal was â€consistent with all the court of appeals decisions interpreting the law.â€ The three women in the Backpage case, not identified by name in the lawsuit, argued that the law is being used to block enforcement of federal and state statutes against human trafficking and could undermine efforts to combat other crimes such as terrorism and racketeering. According to the women, the site profits from the ads and uses techniques, such as anonymous payments, to help traffickers avoid police detection. A lawyer for the women did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law in California who supports broad protections for speech under the law, said Mondayâ€™s action by the high court â€takes away one of the most powerful and common plaintiff arguments, that a website was designed to capture illegal content.â€ It could also be used to help defend website operators if they were accused of facilitating â€hate speechâ€ online, although such speech may not be illegal in the first place due to free speech protections under the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, Goldman said. Backpage has faced scrutiny from the U. S. Senate as well as civil lawsuits over allegations that the website facilitates sex trafficking, especially of children. Its CEO, Carl Ferrer, was arrested last October on criminal charges including pimping but a California state judge later threw out the case against Ferrer and Backpageâ€™s controlling shareholders, ruling that the Communications Decency Act barred prosecution. California prosecutors subsequently refiled charges against the executives, and the case is pending. The case is Jane Doe No. 1 et al v.

House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and top members of Donald Trumpâ€™s transition team on Monday discussed a controversial plan to tax imports during an evening meeting on Capitol Hill, a Trump adviser said. Trumpâ€™s incoming chief strategist Stephen Bannon said the meeting examined two provisions of Ryanâ€™s â€Better Wayâ€ tax reform blueprint, including a measure intended to boost U. S. manufacturing by taxing imports while exempting U. S. business export revenues from corporate taxation. The discussion also focused on a House â€territorialâ€ tax proposal that would end U. S. taxation on the foreign profits of U. S. multinationals, Bannon told reporters as more than a Trump transition team members left the hour meeting. Bannon said the discussion involved â€working throughâ€ border adjustability and added that the territorial measure was â€also what this meetingâ€™s about. Start working through it, make sure everybody understands it and is on the same page.â€ Some tax experts believe Trump has signalled his support for the border adjustability provision in recent tweets warning that companies including automakers could face a border tax if they expand manufacturing abroad and ship products back to the U. S. market. Trump and Ryan agree that tax reform should reduce tax rates for individuals and businesses, do away with longstanding tax loopholes and broaden the tax base in order to drive U. S. economic growth. Advocates say the House Republican measure could help Trump meet his pledge of boosting manufacturing jobs in the United States. It would also pay for lower tax rates by raising more than $1 trillion in revenues over 10 years, analysts say. But some industries including retailers, automakers and oil refiners claim it would raise consumer prices by making exports more expensive. Other critics say it could be vulnerable to a challenge before the World Trade Organization. House Republicans say their territorial provision would bring the United States into line with other countries that do not tax their businessâ€™s foreign profits. Up to now, Trump has favored maintaining the current U. S. tax system, which taxes U. S. earnings abroad but allows companies to defer taxes until profits are returned. U. S. corporations have sought to avoid the tax by stashing about $2. 6 trillion in earnings overseas. Also attending Mondayâ€™s meeting with Ryan and his staff were Trumpâ€™s Jared Kushner, Treasury Steven Mnuchin, incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn.

Senate, Chuck Schumer, decried what he called undue haste to confirm Donald Trumpâ€™s nominations for various top posts, saying on Monday they needed more thorough vetting. Hearings start on Tuesday for the Republican â€™s choices for senior administration posts, beginning with U. S. Senator Jeff Sessions, nominated to be attorney general, and retired General John Kelly, Trumpâ€™s pick for secretary of homeland security. Schumer said Trumpâ€™s nominees, many of whom have extensive business backgrounds at companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp and Goldman Sachs, should be carefully scrutinized to be sure they avoid conflicts of interest. â€Weâ€™re not doing this for sport. Democrats feel very strongly that pushing for a thorough and thoughtful vetting process is the right thing to do,â€ Schumer said in a speech. Republicans, who control the majority in the Senate, are presenting the Democratic objections as political grandstanding, saying they moved quickly eight years ago to confirm Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s Cabinet picks, approving seven the day he began his first term. Schumer said some of Trumpâ€™s nominees have not completed a review process conducted by the U. S. Office of Government Ethics. Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer said on Monday that every nominee with a hearing this week has turned in the required paperwork. â€Everybody will be properly vetted as they have been in the past,â€ said U. S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, speaking in New York after meeting with Trump on Monday. He said he hoped to confirm six or seven national security appointees by the time Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump needs to keep the 52 Republicans in the Senate on his side to secure the simple majority votes needed for confirmations. One of the more contentious hearings could be over Rex Tillerson, nominated for secretary of state. Trumpâ€™s stated desire for warmer relations with Russia comes at a deeply sensitive moment, after U. S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow used cyber hacking and other methods to try to tilt the U. S. presidential election in Trumpâ€™s favor over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Republicans including U. S. Senator John McCain and U. S. Senator Lindsey Graham, veterans in foreign policy and security issues, have signaled concerns about Tillersonâ€™s ties to Russia during his tenure as the chief executive of Exxon Mobil. Transition officials expressed confidence that Tillerson would win the pairâ€™s support. Sessions is also likely to face a thorough grilling, with critics arguing he obstructed civil rights protections in the past. Democrats are likely to question nominees for positions related to national security about Trumpâ€™s proposal to build a wall along the U. S. border with Mexico and his pledge to temporarily suspend immigration from regions deemed to be exporting terrorism. The Trump team has put the nominees through mock hearings that are standard practice ahead of such events. Questions have included the kind of everyday concerns that periodically upset nominees for high office, such as the price of a gallon of gas. Each has also included at least one disruptive pretend protester, a transition official said.

"461","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-concealment-idUSKBN14T1NG?il=0","Zachary Fagenson and David Shepardson","Volkswagen AG ( ) suffered a new setback on Monday when an executive was charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States over the companyâ€™s diesel emissions cheating and the automaker was accused of concealing the cheating from regulators. Oliver Schmidt, who was general manager in charge of VWâ€™s environmental and engineering office in Michigan, did not enter a plea at an initial appearance in U. S. District Court in Miami on Monday and was ordered held pending a hearing on Thursday by U. S. Magistrate Judge William C. Turnoff. Schmidt, who was shackled and wearing a jail uniform, was charged with fraud and conspiracy in not disclosing a cheating device used to rig U. S. diesel emissions tests from 2006 through 2015. He was arrested on Saturday in Florida after attempting to return to Germany from a vacation there, the Justice Department said. Schmidtâ€™s lawyer David Massey said Schmidt had learned of the investigation and reached out to the U. S. Federal Bureau of Investigation to offer to cooperate. Schmidt then met with FBI agents in London last year, he said. The arrest was first reported by the New York Times. The arrest and court appearance come as VW nears a $3 billion plus and potentially $4 billion settlement with the Justice Department and Environmental Protection Agency to resolve civil and criminal investigations into the diesel scandal, which sources have told Reuters could be announced as soon as Wednesday. Talks are still under way about some details of the settlements and no deal has been reached, sources said. An FBI complaint unsealed on Monday against Schmidt said he and other VW employees told executive management about the â€existence, purpose and characteristicsâ€ of an emissions cheating device in July 2015, and that the executives chose not to immediately disclose it to U. S. regulators. The FBI complaint accused VW of deliberately misleading regulators about cheating pollution tests in the United States, but did not charge the company with a crime. Schmidt and other employees gave a presentation about the â€defeat deviceâ€ on or about July 27, 2015, more than a month before the automaker disclosed the device to U. S. regulators in September 2015, the complaint said. The cheating allowed nearly 580, 0000 of VWâ€™s U. S. diesel vehicles sold since 2009 to emit up to 40 times legally allowable pollution levels. â€In the presentation, VW employees assured VW executive management that U. S. regulators were not aware of the defeat device,â€ the complaint said. â€Rather than advocate for disclosure of the defeat device to U. S. regulators, VW executive management authorized its continued concealment.â€ One slide in the presentation included â€Indictment?â€ if regulators did not approve its diesel software for 2016 models, according to the complaint. The complaint said that in 2006 VW employees realized they would not be able to meet U. S. diesel emissions standard and decided to create cheating software. Volkswagen said it could not comment on an ongoing legal matter. Hinrich Woebcken, VWâ€™s chief executive of the North America region, told reporters at the Detroit auto show on Monday that the automaker was â€surprisedâ€ by the criminal charge. A U. S. VW employee, James Liang, was charged in September and pleaded guilty to misleading regulators about diesel emissions and agreed to cooperate with the investigation. His sentencing was delayed last week as prosecutors consider charging others, a court filing said. LATEST SETBACK The news comes as VW is trying to convince Americans it has changed its ways. The worldâ€™s automaker emphasized its focus on the U. S. market as it rolled out two new sport utility vehicles at the Detroit auto show, including a new longer Tiguan SUV with more cargo space and a larger Atlas SUV that will be built in Tennessee. â€We intend to take that second chance,â€ Woebcken told reporters who joined VW in January 2016. â€We are on a good path to get things straightâ€ and added that VW is a â€good corporate citizen.â€ He said VW employs 600, 000 people worldwide and they â€are honest peopleâ€ and that it was â€unfortunate that a small group of people generated this disappointment.â€ Much of the companyâ€™s senior management departed following the scandal, including CEO Martin Winterkorn. But the allegations in the FBI filing show how difficult it is proving for VW to draw a line under the biggest business scandal in its history almost 16 months after it broke. On Monday, however, VW shares rose 4. 2 percent to their highest since September 2015 on optimism about the expected U. S. criminal settlement, topping the German DAX index . The shares are still 10 percent below levels. VW admitted in September 2015 to installing the secret defeat device software in hundreds of thousands of U. S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests and make them appear cleaner than they were on the road, and that up to around 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide. The automaker initially blamed a small group of â€rogue engineersâ€ for the and has repeatedly said no current or former board members were involved. The ensuing scandal has cost the company more than $18. 9 billion in provisions and forced it to drop its diesel offensive in the United States. VWâ€™s global brand chief Herbert Diess told reporters on Sunday the company has no plans to ever resume U. S. diesel sales. VW has already agreed to spend up to $17. 5 billion in the United States to address claims from regulators, dealers, and owners. Separately on Monday, a British law firm launched legal action against VW seeking thousands of pounds of compensation each for UK drivers affected by the emissions scandal. In Britain, 1. 2 million cars are affected and Harcus Sinclair UK, which is being supported by Slater and Gordon, said around 10, 000 drivers had already signed up to the legal action before the launch.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ( )( ) Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Monday that uncertainty over Trumpâ€™s trade and tax policies could lead automakers to delay investments in Mexico, and he confirmed plans to create 2, 000 jobs at Fiat Chryslerâ€™s U. S. factories. â€The reality is the Mexican automotive industry has now for a number of years been to try and deal with the U. S. market. If the U. S. market were not to be there, the reasons for its existence are on the line,â€ Marchionne told reporters at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. FCA announced on Sunday it would spend $1 billion to retool factories in Ohio and Michigan to build new Jeep sport utility vehicles, as well as a pickup truck, and potentially move production of a Ram pickup truck to Michigan from Mexico. On Monday, Ford confirmed it would build a new Ranger pickup and a new SUV under the storied Bronco name at a Michigan factory that currently builds Focus small cars. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump criticized Fordâ€™s announcement last year that it would move Focus production to Mexico. Last week, Ford scrapped plans to build the $1. Focus plant in Mexico and said it would invest $700 million in a factory in Michigan. Executives at Ford, Fiat Chrysler and other automakers said during interviews at the auto show their investment decisions were driven by business considerations, not Trumpâ€™s comments. Most major automakers in the U. S. market have substantial operations in Mexico, as well as complex networks of parts makers that supply their factories in the United States and support jobs and investment in states such as Ohio and Michigan. Trump praised Ford and Fiat Chryslerâ€™s latest announcements on his Twitter account on Monday. â€Itâ€™s finally happening Fiat Chrysler just announced plans to invest $1BILLION in Michigan and Ohio plants, adding 2000 jobs,â€ Trump said in a tweet. In a tweet, he added: â€Ford said last week that it will expand in Michigan and U. S. instead of building a BILLION dollar plant in Mexico. Thank you Ford & Fiat C( hrysler).â€ INVESTING IN THE UNITED STATES Trumpâ€™s focus on U. S. automotive jobs, and uncertainty over what policies he may introduce, have been central topics of discussions among industry officials at the annual auto show. Companies ranging from General Motors Co ( ) to Honda Motor Co ( ) to Daimler AG ( ) used the show to highlight new U. S. investments. Toyota Motor Corp ( ) will invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, the same as in the previous five years, North America Chief Executive Jim Lentz said Monday. Honda ( ) will build a new hybrid model that does not have a gasoline counterpart in its lineup. The hybrid will be made in the United States in 2018 at an existing plant, and Honda said it would boost investment at its transmission plant in Georgia. Daimler AG ( ) Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said Sunday the German automaker planned to invest another $1. 3 billion to expand sport utility vehicle (SUV) production at a factory in Alabama. German automaker Volkswagen AG ( ) plans to invest $7 billion in the United States between 2015 and 2019. It is weighing whether to build an electric SUV in the United States or Mexico, Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of the North America Region, told Reuters on Sunday. Volkswagen has had a plant in Mexico for 50 years and it is not shifting any jobs to Mexico from the United States. â€We do not make our investment decisions based on administrative cycles,â€ Woebcken said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show. FCAâ€™s Marchionne said Monday his companyâ€™s decision to invest in expanded truck production in the United States â€was in the works and has been in the works for a long period of time.â€ Marchionne wanted to get out the news about adding jobs and investment in the United States in case the company encountered more criticism from Trump, a person familiar with the situation said on Sunday. ADJUSTING TO TRUMP Marchionne said he has not made a decision on whether to move production of certain Ram pickups from Mexico to the United States, in part because of uncertainty about tariffs. â€Thereâ€™s no commitment to move the . If tomorrow morning Trump decides to impose a border tax on anything that comes up from Mexico, then weâ€™ll have to adjust.â€ Also on Monday, Toyotaâ€™s Lentz warned that a â€border adjustability tax,â€ could add $1, 000 to the cost of a Camry sedan, because it has parts. Ford Motor Co ( ) Chairman Bill Ford Jr and GM Chief Executive Mary Barra have, separately, spoken with Trump in recent days. Ford said he has been â€in relatively frequent contact with him.â€ He said he was encouraged that overhauling the corporate tax code was high on Trumpâ€™s agenda. Barra on Sunday said tax reform and â€streamlining regulations . .. are just two areas that would be extremely beneficialâ€ for Trump to address. Trump has criticized GM for building cars in Mexico while laying off workers in the United States. Barra, who is on an advisory committee to Trump, told reporters that decisions about where to build specific vehicles are made â€two, three four years ago.â€ Overall, she said of Trump, â€we have much more in commonâ€ than areas of disagreement. Marchionne said he had not spoken with Trump or anyone on the presidential transition team. Trump takes office Jan. 20. (Reporting by Nick Carey, David Shepardson and Bernie Woodall",0

Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan also resigned and dissolved the government, a move that had been expected after elections last month but which was delayed two days by the weekend uprising. Disgruntled soldiers demanding the payment of bonuses and wage increases began their revolt on Friday, seizing control of Bouake, the second largest city, before troops in military camps in cities and towns across the country joined the mutiny. Army chief General Soumaila Bakayoko the former military head of a rebellion, who has become increasingly unpopular with many troops was replaced by his second in command, General Sekou Toure, the presidency statement said. Gervais Kouakou Kouassi, superior commander of the National Gendarmerie, and Director General of the National Police Bredou Mâ€™Bia were also replaced by their deputies with immediate effect, according to the statement, read on national television. The uprising of mainly former rebels now integrated into the army was the second such army mutiny in less than three years. As happened in the first uprising, the government conceded to the soldiersâ€™ demands and agreed to pay bonuses likely to cost state coffers tens of millions of dollars. Defence Minister Donwahi was briefly trapped inside the house in Bouake where negotiations took place on Saturday after some mutineers opened fire outside, having initially rejected the timetable for bonus payments. â€I assure you that the president of the republic understands you. He is a man of his word,â€ Donwahi said on Monday in a televised address aimed at the disgruntled soldiers. He said he planned to return to Bouake on Friday to meet again with the mutinous troops. UNSTABLE MILITARY PUTS ECONOMIC RECOVERY AT RISK Years of conflict and a failure to reform the army, cobbled together from rival rebel groups and government soldiers, have left it hobbled by divisions. Ivory Coast, West Africaâ€™s largest economy and worldâ€™s biggest cocoa producer, emerged from a political crisis as one of the continentâ€™s rising economic stars. But Ouattaraâ€™s failure to rein in an factionalised army could threaten that recovery. Duncan, the outgoing premier, had been expected to stand down on Saturday but held off after the army mutiny erupted. â€I have tendered my resignation and that of the government,â€ he said after a meeting with Ouattara. The president retained his majority in the Dec. 18 parliamentary vote. However, Ivorian legislative elections are usually followed by a change of government as a matter of procedure. Ouattara was expected to name a new prime minister in the coming days. Earlier, Guillaume Soro was as president of the National Assembly with 95 percent of the votes cast by deputies. Soro led a rebellion that controlled the northern half of the country for nearly a decade starting in 2002. He later served as prime minister between 2007 and 2012. The governmentâ€™s dissolution paves the way for the implementation of measures contained in a new constitution. Ouattara signed the new charter, which had been approved by referendum, into law in November, casting it as the way to ensure peace is maintained in Ivory Coast. It modifies clauses in the old constitution that lay behind the conflict, especially concerning nationality requirements for presidential candidates. (Additional reporting by Loucoumane Coulibaly",0

"466","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-energy-breakingviews-idUSKBN14T2FZ","Tom Buerkle","(Reuters Breakingviews) Nuclear energy is having an economic meltdown. Entergy, a $13 billion company, just agreed to close a plant 30 miles north of New York City, blaming the low cost of natural gas. More operators are bound to follow suit. The Indian Point site has generated controversy for decades. A lightning strike at a nearby power substation triggered a Big Apple blackout in 1977. After the Sept. 11 attacks, fears grew that Indian Point could be a target. The partial meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan ended any political support. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo insisted there was no way to evacuate 17 million people who live in the vicinity. Entergy, which completed its acquisition of Indian Point just five days before has been fighting to renew its license for years. The market ultimately forced a retreat, with the facilityâ€™s two reactors closing by 2021. Abundant shale gas has driven wholesale power prices down by about 45 percent over the past decade, effectively slashing Indian Pointâ€™s revenue by some $575 million a year. For Entergy, which is shuttering four other sites, wholesaling nuclear no longer make sense. Other utilities are reaching a similar conclusion. Five nuclear plants have been shut down in the past five years and companies plan to retire five more by 2025. Toshiba, meanwhile, lost 42 percent of its market value last month after disclosing writedowns. The Tennessee Valley Authority did open a 1. 1 megawatt nuclear plant in October, and four other reactors are currently under construction in Georgia and South Carolina. Donald Trump has said he wants to expand the sector, but also seems more inclined to support fossil fuels. After all, he has tapped former Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson to be in his cabinet. Putting a price on carbon and allowing it to be traded would ascribe fresh value to the lack of emissions in nuclear. Any effort devoted to pushing such a plan at this point, though, probably would be a waste of energy.

"467","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-usa-environment-idUSKBN14T223","Marc Frank","Cuba and the United States agreed on Monday to jointly prevent, contain and clean up oil and other toxic spills in the Gulf of Mexico, as they rush to conclude deals before Donald Trump takes office. U. S. Charge dâ€™Affaires Jeffrey DeLaurentis, upon signing the agreement, said it was one of a series of deals to protect the shared marine environment of the two neighboring countries separated by just 90 miles (145 km) of water. Trump has threatened to scrap a detente between the two countries unless Cuba makes further political and economic concessions. U. S. companies and the outgoing administration of President Barack Obama have announced a flurry of small deals in recent weeks aimed at making it harder for Trump to ditch the detente established by Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro in 2014. The former Cold War foes said last month that they hoped to sign as many as six cooperation accords before Jan. 20, when President Barack Obama leaves office. The oil spill pact, also signed by Cuban Deputy Transportation Minister Eduardo Rodriguez Davila, calls for the parties to prepare joint disaster plans, test them and train personnel, among other measures. Cuba and foreign partners drilled four offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2012, raising concerns that U. S. sanctions meant the United States was not in a position to respond to a spill that could be carried by currents to its coast. The wells came up dry, but Cuba says it plans to drill again. â€œThis agreement is especially important for people living in coastal communities along the northern coast of Cuba and southern Florida because it provides a strong measure of protection against future disasters,â€ Dan Whittle, head of Cuba projects at the New Environmental Defense Fund, said. Obama has used executive orders to improve relations and punch holes in the U. S. trade embargo, which can only be lifted by Congress. The deals and orders can be reversed by Trump. More than a dozen cooperation accords have been inked to date, ranging from postal services and law enforcement to protecting marine life and fighting drug trafficking. Negotiations are ongoing over difficult issues such as U. S. nationalization compensation claims, Cubaâ€™s demand for embargo reparations, extraditing fugitives and the return of the Guantanamo Naval Base to Cuba. Last week a deal was struck to export small amounts of charcoal to the United States and in December Google signed an agreement to place servers on the island to quicken access to its products.

"469","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airbus-deliveries-idUSKBN14T1PC","Tim Hepher","Airbus ( ) is set to post an 8 percent rise in deliveries for 2016, beating expectations, after a sprint to the finish line that narrowed the gap with Boeing, according to industry experts and records of aircraft movements. The European planemaker was forced to accelerate deliveries sharply in December to meet its target after production problems earlier in the year. It delivered over 100 jets last month, a Reuters analysis of data supplied by FlightRadar24, unofficial airport data and reports suggests, lifting its 2016 tally well above 680 including 60 of the delayed A320neo. One industry expert estimated the total as high as 688, well above the companyâ€™s informal target of more than 670. Airbus remains in second place behind Boeing ( ) but its growth contrasts with a 2 percent drop in 2016 deliveries reported by its U. S. nemesis last week, to 748 planes. The Airbus performance, up from 635 in 2015, is the latest evidence that planemakers are racing to whittle down big order backlogs and hoard cash as they face a potentially worsening slowdown in orders that began in 2015. Boeing temporarily eased output last year to make way for a new model but, like Airbus, plans to increase production of its aircraft. An Airbus spokesman declined to comment. Shares in Europeâ€™s largest aerospace company clawed back losses to end up 0. 2 percent in a weaker Paris market. The European planemaker is keeping operational data tightly under wraps ahead of its annual news conference on Wednesday. Airbusâ€™s December deliveries would set a monthly record for the company, beating the previous peak by more than a quarter. The gap between Christmas and New Year, traditionally a groggy period for European industry, saw a record burst of activity at Airbus plants in France and Germany and included one of its busiest ever days with eight jets flying away on Dec. 29. â€I was amazed,â€ said a veteran of such operations. Aiming to stay ahead of Boeing in the race for new orders, rather than deliveries where it lags, Airbus may book for December at least part of a recent order for 100 jets from Iran and tie up loose ends including completing a deal for 72 jets with Indiaâ€™s GoAir. It may announce a $6. 4 billion order for 60 jets from Saudi carrier flynas, two sources said. Airbus needs to announce at least 259 orders for December to beat Boeingâ€™s 2016 total of 668. With outspoken sales chief John Leahy expected to retire in the second half of this year, Airbus is looking to end 2016 with a flourish, though analysts say prices could suffer due to weakening global economies. CASH GENERATION Airbus delivered at least 70 jets in December, according to the sources and data, also a record. These included at least 17 of the new A320neo, whose had been disrupted by delays in receiving new engines from Pratt & Whitney ( ). That brought 2016 deliveries of jets the most models to over 540. It also delivered more than 140 . Airbus expected to deliver more than 670 aircraft in 2016, unofficially revised up from 650 in October. It is accelerating deliveries of the existing A320 to keep cash pouring in from airlines while it adopts a more conservative timeframe for the switchover to the A320neo. deliveries generate cash for other developments and are increasingly vital as demand for larger aircraft suffers from a looming capacity glut. Experts say the delays in A320neo deliveries have masked some pressure on demand for those models too, caused by low oil prices that can make earlier versions just as attractive. On its other main Airbus delivered over 62 A330s in 2016, according to the estimates. But it was forced to step up customer financing to maintain that pace as major customer Turkey faced turmoil after a failed coup and as European states withheld export credits in a row over Airbus payments to sales agents. Airbus itself provided the financing for all seven new Turkish Airlines A330s in 2016, industry sources say. Despite separate delays due to shortages of cabin equipment, Airbus unexpectedly hit a target for at least 50 deliveries of the newer A350 after 16 in December, sources said last week. That includes one or two jets paid for but not yet in operation. The rush to get planes away extended to the mammoth A380 as Airbus delivered seven in December, including three in two days to dominant customer Emirates. That brought the annual total to 28, up one from the previous year and enough to keep Europeâ€™s troubled superjumbo project at breakeven in 2016. However, it plans to cut A380 output from next year after demand sagged for the worldâ€™s largest jets. The program took another blow in late December when Emirates, under pressure from the impact of low oil prices on Gulf economies, delayed some 2017 deliveries. That could put the iconic plane back into loss in 2017, marring celebrations for its 10 years in service. (Reporting by Tim Hepher",0

S. crude futures CLc1 settled down $2. 03 at $51. 96 a barrel, while Brent futures LCOc1 settled down $2. 16 at $54. 94 a barrel. In Iraq, OPECâ€™s producer, oil exports from the southern Basra ports reached a record high of 3. 51 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, the oil ministry said. OPEC members agreed in November on the first deal to cut oil output since 2008, limiting supplies to 32. 5 million bpd starting Jan. 1 for six months. Iraqâ€™s oil ministry underscored that the high levels from the south would not affect the countryâ€™s decision to cut January production to comply with the OPEC agreement. But some remained concerned over the feasibility of the cuts, which would have to come from the north. â€We have compliance with the Gulf countries, but the rest of the slate is looking a bit shaky,â€ said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. â€With the big numbers coming out of the southern port of Basra for December . .. itâ€™s implying that Iraq may be the first big crack in the wall of the OPEC agreement,â€ he added. Sources also told Reuters that Iraqâ€™s State Oil Marketing Company had given three buyers in Asia and Europe full supply allocations for February. The lower optimism comes even though Russia, one of the worldâ€™s largest crude producers, is apparently sticking with the agreement to cut. Russian energy market sources told Reuters the countryâ€™s output had fallen by 100, 000 bpd in the first week of the month. Kuwaitâ€™s oil minister added on Monday that an OPEC committee will meet in Vienna on Jan. to monitor compliance and agree on a â€final monitoring mechanism.â€ Last week, U. S. energy companies added oil rigs for a 10th week in a row, Baker Hughes data showed, with some analysts expecting the U. S. rig count will rise to by the end of the year. Dealers say that the recent uptick in U. S. shale hedging to protect future output for 2018 and beyond could put more pressure into the market. They add that high inventories nationwide are still a hurdle for the market. â€The price weakness . .. calls attention to some bearish news that the market had been willing to ignore, such as the high level of (fourth quarter) supply still in transit to consumers and the uptrend in U. S. drilling rigs and actual oil production,â€ said Tim Evans, energy futures specialist at Citigroup, said in a note.

S. officials said on Monday. The incident, which occurred on Sunday and was first reported by Reuters, comes as U. S. Donald Trump prepares to take office on Jan. 20. In September, Trump vowed that any Iranian vessels that harassed the U. S. Navy in the Gulf would be â€shot out of the water.â€ â€This was an unsafe and unprofessional interaction, and that is due to the fact that they were approaching at a high level of speed with weapons manned and disregarding repeated warnings,â€ Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a briefing. The warning shots were fired at the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps boats by the USS Mahan after it established radio contact but failed to get them to slow down, Davis said, confirming earlier accounts of U. S. defense officials. Those officials, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the Iranian vessels came within 900 yards (800 meters) of the Navy destroyer, which was escorting two other U. S. military ships. The Mahan also fired flares and a U. S. Navy helicopter also dropped a smoke float before the warning shots, they said. The IRGC and Trump transition team were not immediately available for comment. The White House said the Iranian vessels had behaved in an unacceptable manner and that such incidents risked increasing tensions. â€At this point the United States does not know what the intentions of the Iranian vessels were, but the behavior is not acceptable given that the USS Mahan was operating in international waters,â€ White House spokesman Josh Earnest said during a press conference on Monday. Years of mutual animosity eased when Washington lifted sanctions on Tehran last year after a deal to curb Iranâ€™s nuclear ambitions. But serious differences still remain over Iranâ€™s ballistic missile program as well as conflicts in Syria and Iraq. One of the U. S. defense officials said similar incidents occur occasionally. Most recently in August, another U. S. Navy ship fired warning shots toward an Iranian craft that approached two U. S. ships. In January 2016, Iran freed 10 U. S. sailors after briefly detaining them in the Gulf. The one official added that the warning shots fired on Sunday were just one of seven interactions the Mahan had with Iranian vessels over the weekend, but the others were judged to be safe.

N. envoy said a deal to resolve one of Europeâ€™s most enduring conflicts was within reach. Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci and Greek Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, launched a week of consultations in Geneva to tackle dozens of disagreements stemming from the 1974 division of the Mediterranean island. The talks will focus initially on how to handle property disputes stretching back more than 40 years. But with several past reconciliation efforts having failed, both leaders have been careful this week to cool expectations of a quick fix. The United Nations special envoy for Cyprus also said on Monday that the talks were . â€We are now in the final moment. We are now really in the moment of truth. This is actually where will find out if this can be solved,â€ said Espen Barth Eide, a Norwegian diplomat appointed to the U. N. envoyâ€™s job in 2014. â€Iâ€™m not saying on a specific date. Because itâ€™s â€ told a news briefing, urging islanders estranged for decades to â€seize the momentâ€. The talks are scheduled to broaden on Thursday to include Britain, Greece and Turkey, the guarantor powers of Cyprus under a convoluted treaty foisted upon the former colony when it became independent from Britain in 1960. Their concerns will include security, and specifically the role Turkey and its 30, 000 troops stationed in northern Cyprus will play in any reunification of the country as a federation. The rival sides are poles apart on that issue. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan discussed Cyprus by phone for more than an hour on Monday, a Greek government official said. â€Concerning the process, the Greek Prime Minister expressed the view to the Turkish President that he will travel to Geneva only if it is apparent there is the possibility of a deal. â€The two agreed to reassess the situation on the eve of the conference,â€ the official said EXPECTATIONS TEMPERED Asked on arrival at the United Nations in Geneva if he was optimistic, Anastasiades said: â€Ask me when we are finished.â€ Akinci was equally circumspect, saying on Sunday: â€We are not pessimistic, but I see no need for exaggerated expectations that everything will just happen. We are expecting a difficult week.â€ New U. N. Antonio Guterres, who is expected to attend the conference on Thursday, has described the talks as an â€historic opportunityâ€ for a breakthrough. But the issues are difficult. redrawing territorial boundaries, and security issues in a future reunited homeland have all frustrated past negotiations. Property rights are also a sensitive issue for thousands of internally displaced people who were driven from their homes in periods of conflict before, during and after Turkey invaded the islandâ€™s north after a brief coup in 1974. A combination of restitution, compensation and exchange were being discussed on Monday, with International Monetary Fund and World Bank officials included in the talks, though it was unclear how any deal might be paid for. MOMENTUM Despite the expressed caution, mediators are keen to press on while both communities are led by political moderates. Both Anastasiades and Akinci are from Limassol, a port city on Cyprusâ€™s southern coast. Akinci belongs to a dying generation of Turkish Cypriots who speaks almost fluent Cypriot Greek. Dozens of issues remaining after 18 months of talks in Cyprus need to be resolved in the next two days before the sides submit maps outlining their proposals for the future boundaries of the islandâ€™s two constituent states. â€Itâ€™s not easy to make these final agreements . .. It is also possible because I donâ€™t know any issue in these negotiations that really cannot be solved if sufficient will is available,â€ Eide said. Any agreement must be put to separate referendums in the two communities, with diplomats anticipating a vote around June. A previous peace blueprint put to referendum in 2004 was accepted by Turkish Cypriots but rejected by Greek Cypriots. Analysts see the talks as a unique opportunity to settle a conflict which has brought NATO members Greece and Turkey to the brink of war and which is an obstacle to Turkeyâ€™s ambitions of joining the European Union. â€If this time it fails between these two leaders . .. then a huge motivation will be lost,â€ said academic Ahmet Sozen, who has followed the peace talks for years. â€The two leaders have reached a lot of convergences beyond any other set of negotiations in the past. Thatâ€™s for sure. And it would be a sin to waste this.â€ (Additional reporting by Renee Maltezou and Angeliki Koutantou",0

Anthony Murgio, 33, entered his plea in federal court in Manhattan to three counts, including conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, a month before he was to face trial. Under a plea agreement, Murgio agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of about years in prison or less. U. S. District Judge Alison Nathan scheduled his sentencing for June 16. The Tampa, is one of nine people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Prosecutors said Murgio operated Coin. mx, which without a license exchanged millions of dollars into bitcoin, including for victims of ransomware, a computer virus that seeks payment, often in the virtual currency, to unlock data it restricts. Prosecutors said Coin. mx was operated from 2013 to 2015 through several fronts, including one called â€Collectables Club,â€ to trick financial institutions into believing it was a group interested in collectables like stamps. Coin. mx was owned by Israeli citizen Gery Shalon, according to prosecutors, who say he and Joshua Samuel Aaron orchestrated cyber attacks on companies. An attack on JPMorgan resulted in the information of more than 100 million people being stolen. Prosecutors said the men carried out the cybercrimes to further other schemes with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, including pumping up stock prices with sham promotional emails. Murgio, who was not accused of engaging in the hacking scheme, was tied not only to Shalon but also to Aaron. Both men attended Florida State University, and in 2008 they formed a business together. On his website, Murgio called Aaron â€my friendâ€ and said he â€showed me the ropes to online marketing.â€ Aaron was deported from Russia in December and taken into U. S. custody, while Shalon and Orenstein were extradited from Israel in June. All three have pleaded not guilty. Five other individuals have been charged in connection with Coin. mx, including Murgioâ€™s father. Two individuals linked to it are scheduled to face trial on Feb. 6. The case is U. S. v.

S. fashion retailer American Apparel LLC after raising its offer to around $88 million, a person familiar with the matter said Monday. Gildanâ€™s takeover marks the end of an era for the iconic Los company, which was founded in 1998 by an eccentric Canadian university and grew to become a part of U. S. popular culture thanks to its racy advertising. Gildan will not take any of American Apparelâ€™s 110 stores, but will own its brand and assume some of its manufacturing operations, the source said. The deal is subject to a bankruptcy judge approving it on Thursday. American Apparel declined to comment, while Gildan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The source asked not to be identified because details of the bankruptcy auction are confidential. The auction for the retailer also attracted an offer from apparel maker Next Level Apparel, a source said earlier on Monday. However, Gildan won after raising its original $66 million stalking horse bid, the source added. The bankruptcy auction also attracted interest from giant Amazon. com Inc ( ) competitor Forever 21 Inc and brand licensor Authentic Brands Group LLC, which led a consortium to acquire Aeropostale Inc ( ) out of its bankruptcy last year, sources said last week. American Apparelâ€™s struggles show the major challenges facing retailers as more consumers shop online. Several U. S. retailers, including Aeropostale Inc and Pacific Sunwear of California Inc, have filed for bankruptcy in recent months. Gildan plans to assume ownership of some of American Apparelâ€™s manufacturing plants in southern California, one of the largest operations in the United States with about 3, 500 employees, sources have previously said. Gildan makes most of its garments offshore, with close to 90 percent of its 42, 000 employees in Caribbean and Central American countries. It has and distribution centers in cheaper parts of the United States, including North Carolina and Georgia. American Apparel filed its second Chapter 11 in November with about $177 million in debt after the failure of a turnaround plan implemented by its owners, a group of former bondholders. The company filed its first Chapter 11 in October 2015, and emerged early last year. The companyâ€™s finances had deteriorated quickly. In 2013, it recorded sales topping $633 million, capping off a period of growth. In 2014, founder and Dov Charney was removed from the company. Sales declined, hitting $497 million in 2015, according to bankruptcy court records. (Reporting by Jessica DiNapoli",0

Ariad stock was up 73 percent at $23. 77 in morning trading on Monday. In 2016, its shares had nearly doubled. Takedaâ€™s blood cancer drug Velcade is expected to face generic competition this year and other key products go off patent from 2020. Cancer drugs are appealing to large drugmakers, with high prices being paid for promising assets. San Medivation was bought by Pfizer Inc ( ) for $14 billion in August. Given the scarcity of oncology assets and significant potential synergies, other Ariad bidders could emerge, SunTrust Robinson analysts said. In November, Reuters reported that Takedaâ€™s negotiations to acquire Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Incâ€™s ( ) Salix business had stalled, citing sources. With the Ariad deal, the Japanese drug giant gains access to the leukemia drug, Iclusig, which is expected to generate sales of $170 $180 million in 2016. Ariad came under fire in October for price increases of Iclusig. A U. S. Food and Drug Administration decision on its lung cancer treatment, brigatinib, which is being touted as a potential blockbuster, is expected by April. Sarissa Capital Management LP, a hedge fund run by investor Carl Icahnâ€™s former healthcare lieutenant, had announced a stake in Ariad in 2013. Sarissa will tender its shares to Takeda, if the deal goes through. Ariad suspended Iclusig sales in 2013 after data showed it was associated with serious complications, but resumed marketing after the FDA sanctioned its use in a narrower patient population.

The deal caps months of negotiations between the chain, private equity firms including Carlyle and TPG Capital Management LP [TPG. UL] as well as several Chinese suitors. The U. S. fast food chain said local partners will help speed up growth in the worldâ€™s No. 2 economy through new restaurant openings, particularly in smaller cities that are expected to benefit from increased urbanization and income growth. â€McDonaldâ€™s globally overall is struggling and didnâ€™t have the money or intellectual resources to focus on China,â€ said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group. The company has more than 2, 400 restaurants in mainland China and roughly 240 in Hong Kong. The new partnership plans to add 1, 500 in the two areas over the next five years. Under the deal, Hong CITIC Ltd will own about 32 percent of the business, with CITIC Capital, an affiliate company that manages private equity funds and other alternative assets, holding another 20 percent. Carlyle will control 28 percent of the business, while McDonaldâ€™s will retain a 20 percent stake, the companies said in a statement. The deal will be settled in cash and in shares in the new company that will act as the master franchisee for the period. McDonaldâ€™s originally wanted to raise up to $3 billion from the sale of the business, but later decided to keep a minority stake to benefit from exposure to future growth in China, a person with direct knowledge of the plans previously told Reuters.

"477","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-sessions-idUSKBN14U182","Julia Edwards Ainsley","U. S. Donald Trumpâ€™s pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, promised on Tuesday to stand up to Trump, his close ally and future boss, saying he would oppose a ban on Muslims entering the country and enforce a law against waterboarding even though he voted against the measure. Questioned for hours by a U. S. Senate committee responsible for confirming his appointment, Sessions, a U. S. senator from Alabama, distanced himself from comments he had made defending Trump from criticism over a 2005 video that emerged in October showing Trump boasting about grabbing womenâ€™s genitals. At the time, Sessions told The Weekly Standard magazine he would not characterize the behavior as sexual assault. He later said the comments were taken out of context. Asked on Tuesday whether â€grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent is . .. sexual assault,â€ he replied: â€Clearly, it would be.â€ With 10 days to go before Trump takes office, Sessions, 70, was the first Cabinet nominee to face questioning. He appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Trumpâ€™s pick to run the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine Corps General John Kelly, later went before the Homeland Security Committee. As attorney general, Sessions would serve as the top U. S. law enforcement officer and be responsible for giving unbiased legal advice to the president and executive agencies. With that in mind, lawmakers from both Trumpâ€™s Republican Party and the Democratic Party sought to establish how closely Sessions hewed to Trump positions and whether he could put aside his staunchly conservative political positions to enforce laws he may personally oppose. A senator since 1997, Sessions was widely expected to be confirmed by the Senate. Protesters accusing Sessions of having a poor record on human rights interrupted the Capitol Hill proceedings several times. MUSLIM BAN Sessions said he would not support banning anyone from the United States on the basis of religion and that Trumpâ€™s intentions were to restrict people from countries harboring terrorists, not all Muslims. Elected on Nov. 8, Trump at one point campaigned on a proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country. Sessions said he favored â€higher intensity of vettingâ€ for refugees seeking to enter the United States from countries that harbor terrorists but that he would oppose ending the U. S. refugee program. He also said he would enforce a 2015 law that outlawed waterboarding terrorism suspects even if it meant resisting Trump. The senator said he had voted against the law, believing those in high positions in the military and intelligence community should be able to do so. During the campaign, Trump said waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is widely regarded as torture, was an effective technique and vowed to bring it back and make it â€a hell of a lot worse.â€ More recently Trump has said retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, his nominee for secretary of defense, had persuasively argued against it. Sessions said he would enforce laws upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court, even those he disagreed with, such as decisions making abortion and marriage legal. CLINTON EMAILS Sessions said the comments he made during the 2016 presidential campaign about Democrat Hillary Clintonâ€™s email practices and charitable foundation would cloud the perception of impartiality if the Justice Department continued investigating Clinton. He said he would recuse himself and favored a special prosecutor to carry out any future investigations. Trump, who defeated Clinton, said during the campaign that if elected, he would ask his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to see that Clinton go to prison for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state and her relationship with her familyâ€™s charitable foundation. Sessions said he agreed with Trump in opposing Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s executive action that granted temporary protection to immigrant children brought to the country illegally by their parents and would not oppose overturning it. Sessions, representing the deeply conservative Southern state of Alabama, has long opposed legislation that provides a path to citizenship for immigrants. He has also been a close ally of groups seeking to restrict legal immigration by placing limits on visas used by companies to hire foreign workers. Sessions said he would be more aggressive in investigating and prosecuting abuses of the visa program, which he said allows companies to discriminate against American workers by hiring foreigners. As head of the Justice Department, the attorney general oversees the immigration court system that decides whether immigrants are deported or granted asylum or some other kind of protection. Sessions renewed his criticism of the Obama administration for not being tougher on countries that refuse to take back criminal migrants ordered deported from the United States. A key plank of Trumpâ€™s election campaign was his pledge to deport illegal immigrants and build a wall along the U. S. border with Mexico. Kelly told his hearing a physical barrier on its own is not enough to keep people and drugs from illegally entering the United States. In written testimony, Kelly said that â€rapidly processingâ€ and deporting immigrants in â€significant numbersâ€ would deter future illegal migration. The U. S. immigration court system has a backlog of over 500, 000 cases awaiting a decision on deportation, asylum or some other kind of protection. Many migrants arriving at the U. S. border are given a notice to appear in court one to three years in the future. DEFENSE AGAINST RACISM Before the Judiciary Committee, Sessions several times defended himself against charges of racism. He said allegations that he harbored sympathies toward the Ku Klux Klan, a violent white supremacist organization, were false. â€I abhor the Klan and what it represents and its hateful ideology,â€ Sessions said in his opening remarks. Sessions was denied confirmation to a federal judgeship in 1986 after allegations emerged that he made racist remarks, including testimony that he called an prosecutor â€boy,â€ an allegation Sessions denied. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said the Senate Judiciary Committee had received letters from 400 civil rights organizations opposing his confirmation to the countryâ€™s top law enforcement post.

Kennedy Jr. said he would chair a presidential panel to review vaccine safety and science at U. S. Donald Trumpâ€™s request, drawing fierce criticism from vaccine experts who fear such a panel would give credence to debunked theories tying childhood immunizations to autism. â€ Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policy, and he has questions about it,â€ Kennedy, who has raised questions about the safety of vaccines, told reporters after a meeting with Trump in New York on Tuesday. â€He asked me to chair a commission on vaccine safety and scientific integrity. I said I would,â€ said Kennedy. However, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks later told Reuters that, while the was exploring the possibility of forming a committee on autism, â€no decisions have been made at this time.â€ Kennedy, an environmentalist and lawyer, is the son of the late U. S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York and the nephew of assassinated Democratic President John F. Kennedy. Vaccine experts decried the announcement by a vaccination skeptic that he would head a panel to explore the safety of vaccines and their purported link with autism. The association was raised by a paper published in the British medical journal in The Lancet in 1998 that claimed to find a connection between the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism. That paper has been debunked, and The Lancet withdrew the study. Since then, numerous studies have affirmed the safety of the vaccine. The American Academy of Pediatrics said vaccines are â€the most significant medical innovation of our time,â€ adding that claims that vaccines are linked to autism or are unsafe have been disproven â€by a robust body of medical literature.â€ In addition to measles, mumps and rubella, vaccines protect children and adults against a wide variety of deadly or crippling diseases, including polio, typhoid, diphtheria and tetanus. Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt Universityâ€™s medical school in Nashville, Tennessee, who advises the federal panel that sets U. S. vaccine policy, said the Kennedy news reinforces the concerns of public health officials, pediatricians and family doctors. Schaffner said Kennedy has â€raised issues that have been settled securely and completely by good science.â€ Nevertheless, concerns have persisted over a link between vaccines and autism, a range of symptoms that often includes difficulties with communication and social interaction. Kennedy, 62, said Trump, 70, was â€very as am I,â€ but said, â€Everybody ought to be able to be assured that the vaccines that we have (are) . .. as safe as they possibly can be.â€ In 2014, Trump, a New York businessman who was not yet a presidential candidate, posted on Twitter, â€I believe in vaccinations but not massive, all at once, shots. Too much for small child to handle. Govt. should stop NOW!â€ Kennedy in 2005 wrote an article for Rolling Stone magazine and the Salon. com website asserting that the government was conspiring to cover up the connections between autism and thimerosal, a preservative formerly used in vaccines. Salon. com later retracted the article because of factual errors, and Rolling Stone deleted it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no evidence of harm caused by thimerosal in vaccines. Thimerosal was never used in the MMR vaccine. CDC said research does not show a link between thimerosal in vaccines and autism. As a precaution, it was removed from childhood vaccines in the United States in 2001. Daniel Johnson, a pediatric infectious disease expert at University of Chicago Medicine, said he thought yet another investigation into vaccine safety was a waste of public money. â€Thereâ€™s already many systems in place to provide oversight, to record data, which is constantly being reviewed by many in government and the scientific community,â€ Johnson said. â€There is no need for still yet another system for doing this.â€ Johnson said he was â€very concernedâ€ that parents may delay getting their children vaccinated as they await word from a vaccination safety panel, which could result in â€increased harm, illness and potentially deathâ€ of children from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines.

Comey also told lawmakers Russia did not release information obtained from the state campaigns or the old RNC email domains, comments that may buttress the U. S. intelligence view that Moscow tried to help Trump against Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. U. S. intelligence agencies on Friday released an assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a covert effort to help Republican Trumpâ€™s electoral chances by discrediting Clinton. The report, which omitted classified details, was the U. S. governmentâ€™s starkest public description of what it says was a Russian effort to manipulate the American electoral process by leaking hacked emails from Democrats. Russia has denied interfering in the election but President Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian suspected spies from the United States and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies last month in response to the allegations. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told a news conference on Tuesday those penalties were â€a start and not the endâ€ of U. S. retaliation for the hacks, and senior officials have suggested covert action may be taken. Comey told lawmakers the Federal Bureau of Investigation â€did not develop any evidence that the Trump campaign, or the current RNC, was successfully hacked.â€ He did not say whether Russia had tried to hack Trumpâ€™s campaign. Trump has disputed the accusations of Russian cyber attacks during the election, but his incoming chief of staff said on Sunday that the New York businessman accepts the U. S. intelligence communityâ€™s conclusions that Russia was responsible, and that further action may be taken against Moscow. SENATE HEARING Comey declined to comment on whether or not the FBI might be investigating links between Russia and associates of Trump, who frequently called during the campaign for improved relations between Washington and Moscow. The FBI director was pressed by Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, to publicly provide a declassified answer to the question before Jan. 20, the day Trump will be inaugurated, but Comey suggested he would unable to do so. Comey appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee along with the director of national intelligence, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency and the chief of the National Security Agency at a time of controversy in Washington about the 2016 election. Testifying before Congress for the first time since Trump beat Clinton on Nov. 8, Comey has been criticized by Democrats for statements about a separate investigation into Clintonâ€™s use of a private email server as secretary of state. The controversy over Russiaâ€™s alleged role in attempting to influence the election has roiled Washington, with Democratic lawmakers calling for an independent commission to investigate the matter and Republicans worried that the affair might call into question the legitimacy of Trumpâ€™s victory. Comey said there was evidence Russia hacked Republican political campaigns and â€oldâ€ email domains that the RNC was no longer using. In contrast, Fridayâ€™s report assessed that Russian military intelligence used intermediaries such as WikiLeaks, DCLeaks. com and the Guccifer 2. 0 â€personaâ€ to release emails that it had acquired from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats as part of the effort to help Trump and harm Clinton. The DNC denied â€multiple requestsâ€ made by the FBI to examine its hacked servers, Comey said. He added that his agents relied on a forensic analysis conducted by the cyber security firm CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to help clean up the hack when it was detected last spring. Senior U. S. Republican and Democratic senators introduced legislation on Tuesday seeking to impose a wide range of sanctions on Russia over its cyber activities and actions in Syria and Ukraine.

"480","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autoshow-diesel-idUSKBN14U2IY","David Shepardson","Automakers unveiled several new diesel models at the Detroit auto show this week, hoping to dispel the doubts created by Volkswagenâ€™s diesel emissions scandal and revive interest in a technology that offers benefits under fuel economy regulations. Ford Motor Co ( ) said it would offer a diesel version of its pickup truck for the first time in 40 years, while General Motors Co ( ) said Sunday it will offer a diesel version of its compact GMC Terrain SUV. Last year, GM announced it will start selling diesel versions of it Chevrolet Equinox and Chevrolet Cruze car, while in November Mazda Motor Co ( ) said it would start selling a diesel version of its 2017 SUV in the United States later this year. Automakers are pushing diesels in part because they offer higher mileage and better performance, particularly for heavier vehicles, than gasoline engines. The fuel economy boost helps automakers comply with federal greenhouse gas limits. The improvements in towing and acceleration are attributes automakers believe they can sell. â€I think weâ€™d be very stupid to forego the benefits of diesel,â€ Daimler AG ( ) chief executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters at the auto show. With their CO2 emissions 15 to 20 percent below equivalent gasoline engines, he said, diesels will â€continue to be very relevantâ€ to efforts to meet climate goals. In April, Daimler said the U. S. Justice Department had asked the carmaker to investigate its emissions certification process for vehicles including its Mercedes brand. Diesels account for a small fraction of U. S. sales, but more than half of all passenger vehicle sales in Europe. Diesel vehicles represented less than 1 percent of all vehicle sales in the United States last year, according to hybridcars. com. Overall diesel sales in the U. S. fell nearly 30 percent in the United States in 2016, as Volkswagen AG ( ) stopped selling diesel models in late 2015 after admitting it had rigged diesel engines to pass government emissions tests. The company on Tuesday confirmed it is negotiating a settlement of a criminal investigation with the U. S. Justice Department and expects to pay $4. 3 billion in penalties and plead guilty to criminal misconduct. VW brand chief Herbert Diess reiterated to reporters on Sunday night in Detroit the brand has no plans to resume sales of diesels. VW is focusing on vehicles and electric vehicle offerings. Diesels accounted for about a quarter of VW brand sales before the scandal erupted. VW U. S. brand sales were down nearly 8 percent in 2016. Regulatory problems have saddled diesel technology with â€an incredibly bad reputationâ€ and made the vehicles â€an incredibly undesirable product, although its usefulness is beyond doubt,â€ Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV chief executive Sergio Marchionne said on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show, without referring to the VW scandal by name. Marchionne said the automaker is spending 500 million euros to meet new European diesel emissions standards. â€Whatâ€™s going to kill diesel is this continuous drain on capital and this continuous skepticism about its value to society,â€ he said.

"481","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-autoshow-suvs-analysis-idUSKBN14U1PG","Alexandria Sage","Global automakers are reworking their product strategies and investments for the United States to bring more sport utility vehicles to showrooms amid a sharp turn away from and cars, executives at Detroitâ€™s auto show say. Carmakers from Toyota Motor Corp ( ) to General Motors Co ( ) to Volkswagen AG ( ) are adding more SUVs to their product plans, amid forecasts that SUVs and pickup trucks could soon make up of U. S. light vehicle sales, up from 56 percent in 2015 and just under 60 percent last year. â€The shift to trucks is profound,â€ said Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc ( ) the largest U. S. auto dealership chain. Sedans are not only losing sales volume, but automakers and dealers are offering bigger discounts to move them out of showrooms, industry executives said. Profit margins on SUVs and trucks are fatter. The average incentive for a midsize car in September was 14. 1 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book, compared with 7. 4 percent for a midsize crossover. The shift has forced some automakers to slash production capacity dedicated just a few years ago to small cars, and put a new emphasis on designing vehicles and assembly plants that can switch quickly from building cars to SUVs. Volkswagenâ€™s Audi unit, for example, builds a small Q2 SUV and its A3 sedan on the same assembly line, Dietmar Voggenreiter, head of sales and marketing for Audi, said in an interview. â€We will always have an SUV and a sedanâ€ on the same production line, he said. Automakers are bringing SUVs into segments that previously were only for cars. Case in point is Nissan Motor Coâ€™s ( ) Rogue Sport, revealed on Monday at the North American International Auto Show, an Americanized version of the small Qashqai SUV Nissan has sold for several years in Europe and Asia. â€The increasing shift of cars to crossovers finally drove our decision to bring this car to the U. S.,â€ said Michael Bunce, vice president of product strategy for Nissanâ€™s U. S. arm. The Rogue Sport will be sold alongside the slightly larger Rogue, appealing to consumers who previously would have had only small cars to choose from. The cars to SUV shift is hitting luxury brands, as well. At German luxury automaker BMW ( ) last year, about 43 percent of U. S. sales were SUVs. In December, that percentage neared 50, said Ian Robertson, the German luxury brandâ€™s global sales chief. â€I think that tells you where the trend is in the U. S. probably on a level,â€ Robertson told Reuters. At Toyota Motor Co ( ) SUVs and trucks will account for about 63 percent of U. S. sales in 2017, said North America CEO Jim Lentz, predicting its RAV4 SUV could top the Camry this year as its U. S. vehicle. Honda Motor Co ( ) is working to expand production of SUVs for the U. S. market, shifting production of the Acura MDX sport utility to a factory in Ohio to make room for additional production of higher volume Pilot SUVs and Ridgeline pickup trucks, Chief Executive Takahiro Hachigo said. Cheap gasoline is emboldening some automakers to add more SUVs based on pickup truck designs after years of shifting SUVs to lighter, unitized body construction. Ford Motor Co ( ) is reviving its Bronco SUV. It was last built in 1996 after gaining notoriety as the vehicle used during O. J. Simpsonâ€™s police pursuit. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Sunday outlined plans to bring back a body on frame SUV for its Jeep line. SEDAN SLOWDOWN The focus on SUVs leaves carmakers who have an overcapacity of sedans in a weak position. Fordâ€™s announcement last week to scrap a planned Mexico factory was attributed to falling U. S. demand for sedans. â€The sedan market is under real pressure. If you donâ€™t have SUVs in all categories you are in serious difficulty,â€ warned Lex Kerssemakers, CEO of Volvo Cars USA, whose flagship U. S. model is the XC90 SUV. Lexus global chief Tokuo Fukuichi said the idea of building a luxury car brand around a large sedan such as the Lexus LS unveiled in Detroit is now â€under assault.â€ Mark Reuss, head of global product development, said the automaker is looking for ways to offer attributes of SUVs in more designs that are more innovative than the vehicles that dominate the category now. â€Youâ€™ll see them in the next year,â€ he said, vehicles that offer â€an alternative to a box.â€ (Reporting By Laurence Frost, Norihiko Shirouzu, Nick Carey, David Shepardson, Paul Lienert, Bernie Woodall and Alexandria Sage.

S. spy agencies on Wednesday, just nine days before he takes over their command as president, and accused them of practices reminiscent of Nazi Germany. The Republican said leaks from the intelligence community led to some U. S. media outlets reporting unsubstantiated claims that he was caught in a compromising position in Russia. â€I think it was disgraceful, disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out. I think itâ€™s a disgrace, and I say that . .. thatâ€™s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do,â€ Trump told a news conference in New York. Trump acknowledged for the first time that Russia likely hacked the Democratic National Committee and the emails of top Democrats during the 2016 presidential election. â€I think it was Russia,â€ he said, pointing out that other countries were also hacking the United States. Trumpâ€™s comments about spy agencies such as the CIA are likely to intensify tensions between the intelligence community and the who initially disparaged its conclusion that a Russian hacking campaign was aimed at boosting his candidacy against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, called a dossier that makes salacious claims about him in Russia â€fake newsâ€ and â€phony stuff.â€ U. S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he spoke with Trump on Wednesday evening and told the he did not believe the media leaks came from the intelligence community. â€I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security,â€ Clapper said in a statement. He defended including the dossier in the intelligence report Trump received on Friday, saying â€part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.â€ Clapper said he emphasized to Trump that the dossier was not produced by the U. S. intelligence community and intelligence officials have not judged whether the information is reliable. MEMO AND REPORTS Two U. S. officials said the allegations about Trump, which one called â€unsubstantiated,â€ were contained in a memo appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election that was presented last week to Trump and to President Barack Obama. Trump said, without offering evidence, that the news he had been briefed on the memo â€was released by maybe the (U. S.) intelligence agencies. Who knows? But maybe the intelligence agencies which would be a tremendous blot on their record if they in fact did that.â€ CNN reported on Tuesday about the existence of the memo. BuzzFeed published a fuller document produced by Christopher Steele, a former British foreign intelligence official, that outlined the allegations of compromising behavior by Trump and alleged links between him and people in Russia. The claims were included in opposition research reports that were made available to Democrats and U. S. officials last year. One U. S. official said investigators had so far been unable to confirm material about Trumpâ€™s financial and personal entanglements with Russian businessmen and others whom U. S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of Russian intelligence. Some material in Steeleâ€™s reports has proved to be erroneous, the U. S. official said. In the news conference, Trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with Moscow during the presidential campaign, and said he had no loans or business deals with Russia. He defended his goal of better ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. â€If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability,â€ he said. The New York real estate developer complained about leaks from meetings he has with intelligence agencies and suggested they were to blame. â€I have many meetings with intelligence. And every time I meet, people are reading about it. Somebodyâ€™s leaking it out,â€ he said. PROTESTS, CHEERS The news conference was a freewheeling affair, with Trump aides cheering from the sidelines at one point and the angrily refusing to take questions from a CNN reporter. Outside, about a dozen protesters gathered behind a police barricade across the street from Trump Tower, holding signs with the slogans â€Dump Trumpâ€ and â€Allegiance To America Not Russiaâ€ as Fifth Avenue traffic streamed by. It was Trumpâ€™s first news conference in about six months and about 250 reporters jammed into the lobby at his Manhattan offices. Questions extended to many issues that will face him when he takes office. He vowed to soon begin negotiations with Mexico on building a border wall and said he will nominate a Supreme Court justice to fill the seat left by the death of conservative Antonin Scalia within two weeks of taking office. He also said he would offer a plan to repeal and replace Obamaâ€™s signature health care law once his choice for health and human services, Tom Price, is confirmed by the Senate. Trump gestured to large stacks of manila folders as he described how he will separate himself from his global business operations, which includes hotels and golf courses as well as assets like a winery and modeling agency, to avoid conflicts of interest once he takes office. He also talked about how he plans to bring manufacturing jobs back from overseas plants, slamming drug companies for â€getting away with murderâ€ on pricing. U. S. stocks slipped to session lows, before recovering ground, as healthcare stocks took a beating following Trumpâ€™s comments on drug pricing.

Unemployment is rising in major emerging economies, especially those reliant on commodity exports such as Russia, South Africa and Brazil, the United Nations agency said. Due to the failure to create jobs, global unemployment is forecast to increase by 3. 4 million people in 2017, bringing the total to 201 million, it said in its annual report World Employment Social Outlook. â€That corresponds to an increase in the rate of unemployment in the world from 5. 7 percent in the year that has just closed to 5. 8 pct in 2017, and this is a tendency driven by deteriorating labor market conditions, particularly in emerging countries,â€ ILO Guy Ryder told a news briefing. â€We have a situation in which, despite relatively high cash holdings, companies seem uncertain about investment. Investment levels are not where they need to be,â€ he added. MIGRATION Globalization and trade liberalization are increasingly questioned, Ryder said, noting that the intentions of the incoming U. S. administration of Donald Trump were a â€major cause of uncertaintyâ€. unemployment remains stubbornly high in Europe, Canada and the United States, the report said. At the same time, social unrest and a lack of decent wages are prompting to migrate from developing regions. â€Migration is an essential part of the world of work, itâ€™s an essential part of stimulating future growth, sharing prosperity, making our global economy more inclusive,â€ said Ryder, a former head of the international trade union ICFTU. â€The irony, dilemma, paradox of our time is that at a moment when the economic case for migration, taken globally, has probably never been stronger, it seems that the social and political obstacles to migration are becoming even higher.â€ Major economies are by insufficient jobs. â€For instance, we note an increase in the unemployment rate in the Russian Federation, South Africa, Brazil . .. and some leveling off at least in Saudi Arabia and again also in Indonesia,â€ said ILO senior economist Steven Tobin. Latin America and the Caribbean remain scarred by recent recessions, while Africa is in the midst of its lowest level of growth in more than two decades, the report said. Latin Americaâ€™s unemployment rate is set to rise by 0. 3 percent in 2017 to 8. 4 percent, largely due to the slowdown in Brazil, the continentâ€™s largest economy, it said.

"484","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-iraq-islamicstate-idUSKBN14W1VI","Stephen Kalin","Iraqi soldiers kicked in the gate of a home in eastern Mosul and emerged moments later with two young men whose hands they bound with plastic ties and dragged off toward black Humvees. The men, at least one suspected of belonging to Islamic State, denied ties to the militants who had been pushed out of the neighborhood a few days earlier. They were pale with fear as they knelt on the ground. Neighbors gathered around, most staring intently but saying nothing. One reaffirmed the accusations and another called one of the menâ€™s brothers â€a dog and the son of a dogâ€. The soldiers loaded the suspects into their vehicles and drove off. Moments earlier and just a few doors down, a widower with a wrinkled face had pleaded with the soldiersâ€™ commander to avenge Islamic Stateâ€™s alleged murder of his brother, wife and son. â€Save us from them, save us from these disbelievers!â€ he shrieked, waving an Islamic State execution order. The general listened calmly before embracing the man, who began to weep on his shoulder. These types of episodes are playing out regularly in the increasing number of areas in eastern Mosul where Iraqi forces have pushed out Islamic State in a U. S. offensive to retake the militantsâ€™ largest urban stronghold. For ordinary residents, a mix of emotions often accompanies the advance, which has picked up pace since the start of the year. There is often initial relief at the clashes moving past their doorsteps and gratitude to the Iraqi soldiers, whom they ply with sweetened tea and kisses. The trauma accumulated over years of the jihadistsâ€™ repressive rule also often pours out unprompted loved ones brutally murdered, homes looted and destroyed, livelihoods decimated, dreams extinguished. Some people are unafraid to air their grievances or finger their transgressors, but others are more cautious, fearful that Islamic State supporters remain at large and are watching. While hundreds, perhaps thousands, of fighters have been killed in the Mosul battle, residents and security officials fear some have simply shaved their beards and melted back into the civilian population. Asked by a Reuters reporter about the two young men detained from their home on Wednesday, an elderly neighbor pleaded ignorance and retreated swiftly into his home. MILITARY WELCOMED The Mosul campaign, involving a ground force of Iraqi troops, members of the autonomous Kurdish security forces and mainly Shiâ€™ite militiamen, is the most complex battle in Iraq since the U. S. invasion in 2003. With much of the eastern half of the city now under government control, most residents have stayed in their homes or moved in temporarily with relatives in other neighborhoods. That has complicated the task of the military, which must fight among civilians in areas against an enemy that has targeted and hidden among them. Commanders from the elite Service (CTS) which has spearheaded the offensive, regularly stop during visits to recently recaptured areas to speak with residents, many of whom know them by name. In front of a partially destroyed mosque in the Baladiyat district on Wednesday, Lieutenant General Abdelwahab removed his cap and bowed his head so an elderly man could kiss him on the forehead. He later greeted a toddler watching frontline clashes from atop a garden wall. In the nearby Sukkar district, women ululated from inside a home as Saadi and other top commanders passed by. They unlatched the door momentarily to toss sweets to the troops. The charred remains of a suicide bomber still littered the street outside. The military says it regularly relies on tips from residents to identify Islamic State infiltrators. One military command post has a hotline number for security information graffitied on its outer wall. Civilians also bring their concerns to the military which they regard as the new sheriff in town, even though the troops remain focused on the battle. Residentsâ€™ requests are largely mundane. A young manâ€™s car got stuck in the mud, can the military help pull it out? Another manâ€™s car is parked near the frontlines, can someone retrieve it for him? â€Please tell someone we just need them to fix the pipe up at the top of the street so we can get our water back,â€ an elderly man says. Water has been cut off in many areas for weeks and electricity is only available by generator for a few hours a day. In district, which Iraqi forces recaptured about two months ago, local men stood outside a schoolyard on Wednesday discussing the future of their city. â€Mosul needs a military ruler,â€ said resident Alaa. â€We cannot allow something like this to happen again.â€ (Editing by Anna Willard) DOHA Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbors, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement. forces edged into the final redoubts of the two capitals of Islamic Stateâ€™s caliphate in Iraq and Syria on Tuesday, hampered by fierce resistance from the militants and the presence of human shields.",0

Ban features an unlikely central character: a New York fashion designer whose wedding was broadcast on reality TV and who authorities said falsely touted ties to Middle Eastern royalty. Malcolm Harris, who has dubbed himself on social media the â€curator of cool,â€ was indicted in a U. S. federal court this week along with two of Banâ€™s relatives in connection with an alleged international bribery scheme. Harris the others and walked away with $500, 000, prosecutors said. Harris faces arrest on the charges, but it is not clear if U. S. authorities know his whereabouts. He told Reuters in a Facebook message on Thursday that he was hiring a lawyer and would not comment on the allegations or his location. â€I would appreciate your patience,â€ he said. Harrisâ€™ husband posted on Instagram this week from Mexico but did not indicate if Harris was with him. The case has roiled Banâ€™s plans to run for president of South Korea after completing his term at the United Nations two weeks ago. Ban, who is not accused of wrongdoing, has said he knew nothing of the case and that he plans to decide soon on his political future. Harris, 52, moves in different circles. His wedding, held on a fashion runway, was featured in 2012 on the Bravo TV network in an episode labeled online as â€Matrimony Fierce.â€ He frequently writes on cultural topics for the Huffington Post, where his profile as an independent contributor described him as a â€creative consultant, cultural icon, and art world aficionado.â€ Fashion publications have said his famous friends include Madonna, that he studied at New Yorkâ€™s Fashion Institute of Technology and that he has lived in Paris and Tokyo. He sold three dresses to Angelina Jolie, despite having twice hung up on her phone calls after mistakenly thinking it was a prankster, the celebrity TV show Access Hollywood reported in 2009. In 2005, he told the Washington Post that as much as he â€adoredâ€ the fashion business, he had become fed up with celebrities â€moochingâ€ free clothing from designers. ALLEGED TIES TO ROYALTY Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said Harris ran into trouble after he told false tales about connections to Middle Eastern royalty. Central to the case is a skyscraper complex in Vietnam built at a cost of $1 billion. In 2014, the South Korean construction firm Keangnam Enterprises Co Ltd, facing a liquidity crisis, was interested in selling the complex, an indictment released on Tuesday said. Harris heard about the possible deal through Joo Hyun Bahn, a real estate broker who is a nephew of the former U. N. and whose father was a Keangnam executive, the indictment said. According to prosecutors, Harris offered to help arrange a sale to a sovereign wealth fund through his claimed connections to Middle Eastern royalty. All he needed, he said, was a commission for himself and money to pay bribes to a Middle Eastern official, according to the indictment. But Harris had no such connections, and after he persuaded the other men to send $500, 000 to his company, Muse Creative Consulting LLC, to pay bribes as a middle man, he kept the money, the indictment said. Harris even forged emails that appeared to be from the Middle Eastern official demanding bribes, the indictment said. He spent the money on airfare, hotels, lavish meals, furniture, rent for a Manhattan apartment and a lease for a penthouse in the fashionable Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg, the indictment said. Joo Hyun Bahn was arrested on Tuesday and pleaded not guilty. His father, Ban who is Ban â€™s younger brother, was also charged and remains at large. Harris, who faces charges that include wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, faces a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and a maximum of 32 years if convicted. The year before the alleged scheme, Harris compared himself in an interview to a character from â€Scandal,â€ a TV drama about a former White House aide who becomes a crisis manager for the rich and powerful. â€People come to me when they have the perfect life, but they want to make it better when they know that there is something missing,â€ he told Whitewall art magazine in 2013.

"488","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-idUSKBN14X1SK","Richard Cowan and Susan Cornwell","U. S. House Republicans on Friday won passage of a measure starting the process of dismantling Obamacare, despite concerns about not having a ready replacement and the potential financial cost of repealing Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s landmark health insurance law. The House of Representatives voted to instruct committees to draft legislation by a target date of Jan. 27 that would repeal the 2010 Affordable Health Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The Senate approved the same measure early Thursday. No Democrats supported the initiative. Nine Republicans voted against the measure. With this vote, Republicans began delivering on their promise to end Obamacare, which also was a campaign promise of Republican Donald Trump. The program, which expanded health coverage to some 20 million people, has been plagued by increases in insurance premiums and deductibles and by some large insurers leaving the system. The resolution passed by the House and Senate does not need presidential approval, since it is part of an internal congressional budget process. But once the Obamacare repeal legislation is drafted, both chambers will need to approve it, and a presidential signature will be required. By that time, Trump will have been sworn in as president. He has urged Congress to act quickly to repeal and replace the Democratic program. Obamacare was enacted nearly seven years ago over Republican objections in an effort to expand coverage and give new protections for people with health conditions and other barriers that left them without insurance. In the past few years, the House has voted more than 60 times to repeal or alter Obamacare, but Republicans had no hope a repeal would become law as long as Obama was president and could veto their bills. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said Obamacare was collapsing and action was urgent. For people who have health insurance through the Obamacare system, he said, â€The deductibles are so high it doesnâ€™t feel like youâ€™ve got insurance in the first place. â€We have to step in before things get worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission,â€ Ryan said. Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi rebutted Republicansâ€™ claims that the law was a failure. â€œThe rate of growth in healthcare costs in our country has been greatly diminished by the Affordable Care Act,â€ she said. â€In the more than 50 years that they have been measuring the rate of growth, it has never been slower than now.â€ The choice before lawmakers, she said, is â€affordable care versus chaos.â€ Harvard University economist David Cutler warned that there could be trouble in U. S. insurance markets if lawmakers do repeal the law but a replacement is slow in coming. â€You could create a lot of havoc,â€ he said, adding that some insurers â€may get out of the market entirely.â€ Trump applauded Congressâ€™s efforts with a Friday morning tweet saying, â€The â€™Unaffordableâ€™ Care Act will soon be history!â€ The who takes office on Jan. 20, pressed lawmakers this week to repeal and replace it â€essentially simultaneously.â€ Republican leaders would like to finish the repeal process within weeks, but some lawmakers think it could take far longer. Some Republicans have expressed concern about starting a repeal before agreeing on how to replace provisions of the complicated and law. The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated repealing Obamaâ€™s signature health insurance law entirely would cost roughly $350 billion over 10 years. Republicans say a good replacement would give states more control of a healthcare program and provide more stability on health insurance premiums.

"489","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-obamacare-changes-idUSKBN14X2KL","Susan Cornwell and Caroline Humer","Urged on by U. S. Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers rushing to scrap Obamacare said this week they hoped to make some changes intended to stabilize the insurance market while they work at repealing and replacing the law. The beginnings of a framework outlining what a world could look like came in the same week that Congress approved a resolution instructing key committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate to draft Obamacare repeal legislation by a target date of Jan. 27. The fate of the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, is a political showdown between Republicans and Democrats that potentially jeopardizes medical coverage for millions of Americans and risks causing chaos in the health insurance marketplace. The law has enabled up to 20 million previously uninsured Americans to obtain health coverage and helped slow the rise in healthcare spending. But Republicans have called it federal government overreach. â€If our general goal is to move decisions out of Washington back to the states, we should be able to make those decisions in the next several months,â€ a key Republican senator working on the repeal, Lamar Alexander, told reporters outside the Senate this week. In a speech on the Senate floor, Alexander indicated Republicans are eyeing some moves insurers have said would help shore up the insurance plans offered on the Obamacare exchanges. The changes could be done by law or by regulation, Alexander said. Alexander said he favors continuing, at least temporarily, the subsidies that millions of Americans receive with their Obamacare plans a kind of financial assistance that helps keep down the cost of deductibles and . He advocates adjusting the special enrollment periods that insurers say are sometimes abused by people who wait until they are sick to sign up for insurance. Insurers have long sought changes that would fix this facet of Obamacare to weed out misuse. It would also help the transition to a new system, Alexander said, if individuals could use government premium subsidies to buy plans outside of the Obamacare marketplace. Alexander is chairman of the Senate health committee, one of the committees drafting the repeal legislation. He told reporters he had discussed his ideas with a number of senators and the process was evolving, but stressed it should be gradual, with some changes made by lawmakers and some by the secretary of Health and Human Services after he is confirmed. Trump has nominated Republican Representative Tom Price for the job. â€Certainty is something the insurance industry needs so they donâ€™t abandon coverage,â€ said Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, another Republican lawmaker who has been working on how to stabilize insurance markets. It was unclear whether lawmakers will reach the ambitious target date of Jan. 27 for drafting repeal legislation. But House Speaker Paul Ryan said on CNN on Thursday that Republicans are moving â€as quickly as they canâ€. The 2010 law, Democratic President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature piece of domestic policy, touches almost all parts of the U.

S. federal and state authorities over its ratings of risky mortgage securities in the to the 2008 financial crisis, the U. S. Department of Justice said on Friday. The credit rating agency reached the deal with the Justice Department, 21 states and the District of Columbia, resolving allegations that the firm contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the department said in a statement. â€Moodyâ€™s failed to adhere to its own standards and fell short on its pledge of transparency in the to the Great Recession,â€ Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Bill Baer said in the statement. S&P Globalâ€™s ( ) Standard & Poorâ€™s entered into a similar accord in 2015 paying out $1. 375 billion. Standard and Poorâ€™s is the worldâ€™s largest ratings firm, followed by Moodyâ€™s. Moodyâ€™s said it would pay a $437. 5 million penalty to the Justice Department, and the remaining $426. 3 million would be split among the states and Washington, D. C. As part of its settlement, Moodyâ€™s also agreed to measures designed to ensure the integrity of credit ratings going forward, including keeping analytic employees out of discussions. The rating agencyâ€™s chief executive also must certify compliance with the measures for at least five years. Moodyâ€™s said that it stands behind the integrity of its ratings and noted that the settlement contains no finding of a violation of law or admission of liability. Moodyâ€™s said it already has implemented some of the compliance measures in the agreement. Moodyâ€™s shares closed at $96. 96 on Friday. The stock plummeted more than 5 percent on Oct. 21, the day it disclosed the Justice Department had notified the firm it was planning to sue over the ratings. Moodyâ€™s settlement on Friday resolved the Justice Department probe without a federal lawsuit. In the Standard & Poorâ€™s case, resolution was reached after the U. S. filed a $5 billion fraud suit. Connecticut, whose attorney general helped lead negotiations, filed a lawsuit against Moodyâ€™s in 2010. Mississippi and South Carolina later sued, and other states had potential claims. Connecticutâ€™s lawsuit claimed that Moodyâ€™s ratings were influenced by its desire for fees, despite claims of independence and objectivity. It also accused Moodyâ€™s of knowingly inflating ratings on toxic mortgage securities. Moodyâ€™s ratings were â€directly influenced by the demands of the powerful investment banking clients who issued the securities and paid Moodyâ€™s to rate them,â€ Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen said in a statement on Friday.

There was no confirmation of the deal from the government, and it was not immediately evident that the terms had been accepted by the rank and file, who took to the streets in Bouake, the second largest city, and other locations on Friday. Soldiers, most of them former rebel fighters, launched a revolt in Bouake a week ago that rapidly gained momentum in the worldâ€™s top cocoa grower until the government was forced to yield to the mutineersâ€™ demands after two days. But the soldiers said they had received none of the 12 million CFA francs ($19, 278) in bonuses they said the government had promised to pay each of them under an initial deal to end the uprising struck last Saturday. â€Weâ€™ve reached an agreement. They will pay five million Monday and the rest each month,â€ Sergeant Mamadou Kone, one of the mutineersâ€™ negotiators, told Reuters. â€We havenâ€™t finished up, but thatâ€™s the most important thing.â€ The soldiers had appeared poised to relaunch their mutiny on Friday. Renegade troops sealed off Bouake as evening fell, even as a government delegation headed by Defence Minister Donwahi pursued talks with the mutinyâ€™s leaders inside the city. Gunfire meanwhile broke out at two strategic military camps in the commercial capital, Abidjan, and mutineers seized entrances to Korhogo, a city in the countryâ€™s north. Ivory Coast has one of the worldâ€™s fastest growing economies but has struggled to resolve deeply entrenched problems left over from years of civil war and political turmoil. The government has failed to bring significant reform to the army, which remains a patchwork of former rebel fighters and troops who stayed loyal to the government during the crisis. Divisions and parallel chains of command persist. Heavy gunfire briefly broke out earlier in Bouake outside the venue for the talks, with mutineers blaming the shooting on soldiers venting their frustration after they accused the government of reneging on its promises. Sporadic gunfire continued through the evening, and telephone networks appeared to have been shut down, hindering communications with the city. Donwahi, his delegation and the mutineersâ€™ negotiators were trapped for several hours during a similar incident during the first round of negotiations last Saturday. But another leader of the mutiny said Donwahi, who was also accompanied by the heads of the army and gendarmes as well as the youth employment minister, was under no threat on Friday. â€Theyâ€™re still here, but we will let them go after. The minister and his delegation will go home without any problems,â€ said the soldier, who asked not to be named. (Reporting by Ange Aboa",0

In a motion filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, lawyers for gambler William â€Billyâ€ Walters contended the agentâ€™s leaks were part in illegal campaign to use secret grand jury information to revive a moribund investigation. â€Strategically leaking grand jury information that is by law required to be kept secret is the antithesis of how our government is allowed to investigate and try to build cases against its citizens,â€ they wrote. â€And yet that is exactly what happened here.â€ Waltersâ€™ lawyers said the FBI used the leaks to obtain leads and revive a case that otherwise would not have been filed. The case could not have been the first time in which FBI agent David Chaves and his squad leaked information, the lawyers said. Representatives for the FBI and Manhattan U. S. Attorney Preet Bhararaâ€™s office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment. A lawyer for Chaves did not respond to a request for comment. The motion came after prosecutors in December revealed that Chaves had admitted to being a â€significant sourceâ€ of information about the investigation in 2013 and 2014 for reporters at The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. Those newspapers published a series of reports beginning in 2014 about the investigation, two years before prosecutors in May brought insider trading charges against Walters, who has built a fortune as a sports bettor. The leaks are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the Justice Departmentâ€™s Office of the Inspector General, prosecutors disclosed Dec. 21. Chaves, an FBI coordinating supervisory special agent, oversaw the squad that conducted the investigation after being involved in numerous white collar cases. Prosecutors said Walters made more than $40 million through insider trading on tips supplied by Thomas Davis, the Dean Foods Coâ€™s ( ) former chairman. In a related civil case, the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Phil Mickelson, who has won three Masters pro golf titles, at one point bought shares in Dean Foods on a recommendation by Walters. Mickelson was not accused of wrongdoing, but he reached an agreement to pay back $1. 03 million the SEC said he earned trading Dean Foods shares. Davis has pleaded guilty.

S. presidential election, three sources familiar with the matter said. The calls occurred between the time the Russian embassy was told about U. S. sanctions and the announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he had decided against reprisals, said the sources. They spoke on condition of anonymity, citing internal U. S. government deliberations about the issue. The calls raised fresh questions among some U. S. officials about contacts between Trumpâ€™s advisers and Russian officials at a time when U. S. intelligence agencies contend that Moscow waged a multifaceted campaign of hacking and other actions to boost Republican Trumpâ€™s election chances against Democrat Hillary Clinton. On Dec. 29, U. S. President Barack Obama announced he had ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats suspected of being spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking U. S. political groups. The administration told Russian Ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, an hour before the decision was made public, one of the sources said. The phone calls between Flynn and Kislyak were first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. A Trump official confirmed one phone conversation between the two men on Dec. 29, and said their understanding was they did not discuss the sanctions. The three sources stressed to Reuters that they did not know who initiated the five calls between Flynn, a former Army general who headed the U. S. Defense Intelligence Agency under Obama, and Kislyak. Nor did they know the contents of the conversations, and declined to say how they learned of them. One source said there was nothing intrinsically odd or wrong about a Russian diplomat speaking to a member of Trumpâ€™s team following the U. S. announcement. Moscow, the source added, probably would want to have some sense of what Trumpâ€™s team thought about the measures. That sentiment was echoed Friday by State Department spokesman Mark Toner. â€This building doesnâ€™t see anything necessarily inappropriate about contact between members of the incoming administration and foreign officials,â€ Toner said. TIMING The other two sources, however, said the timing of the calls raised a question about whether Flynn had given Kislyak any assurances to soothe Russian anger over the U. S. moves. If that were the case, it would have raised a possible entanglement with the Logan Act. The 1799 law bars unauthorized U. S. citizens from negotiating with foreign governments with which the United States has disputes. It is aimed at preventing the undermining of official U. S. government positions. Alexey Mosin, a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Washington, said: â€The Embassy does not comment on multiple contacts, which are carried out on a daily basis with local interlocutors.â€ Flynn raised eyebrows among some U. S. foreign policy veterans when he was pictured sitting at the head table with Putin at a banquet in Moscow in late 2015 celebrating Russia Today, an international broadcasting network funded by the Russian government. However, Flynn has also expressed skepticism about Moscowâ€™s intentions a view that does not seem to fit Trumpâ€™s vision of closer ties with Moscow. Classified documents that the heads of four U. S. intelligence agencies presented last week to Trump included unsubstantiated information compiled by a private security firm suggesting Moscow had compromising personal and financial details about Trump. Trump called a dossier that contains salacious claims about him in Russia â€fake newsâ€ and â€phony stuff.â€ One of the sources said the U. S. actions â€took the Russians by surprise.â€ Russian officials threatened to shutter the School of Moscow, the source said. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov proposed expulsions. But on Dec. 30, Putin announced that he would not retaliate. Trump praised Putin for the decision, writing in a Twitter post, â€Great move on delay (by V. Putin). I always knew he was very smart!â€ Trump spokesman Sean Spicer earlier Friday said Flynn and Kislyak had spoken on Dec. 28, the day before Washington announced the expulsions and sanctions. But a Trump official acknowledged later in the day that they held one conversation on Dec. 29 about setting up a telephone call between Trump and Putin after Trumpâ€™s Jan. 20 inauguration. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was aware of only one phone call between the two that day and did not know if they spoke again since. After the Nov. 8 election, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told the Interfax news agency that the Russian government was in touch with members of Trumpâ€™s political team during the U. S. election campaign and knew most of his entourage. At a news conference on Wednesday, Trump declined to answer whether anyone connected to him or the campaign had contact with Moscow during the campaign and said he had no loans or business deals with or in Russia. White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Friday said it remained unclear whether such a call between Flynn and the Russian ambassador would be objectionable . â€It depends on what they discussed,â€ Earnest told reporters. He said he could not weigh in without knowing the content. (Additional reporting by Warren Strobel, Emily Stephenson, Ayesha Rascoe and Susan Heavey",0
"496","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-china-analysis-idUSKBN14X2LM?il=0","David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick","The incoming U. S. administrationâ€™s tough talk against China has set the stage for showdowns on everything from security to trade and cyberspace, but contradictory signals are sowing uncertainty over how far Donald Trump is prepared to go in confronting Beijing. Highlighting the contested South China Sea as a potential flashpoint, Trumpâ€™s Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson threw out an explosive challenge to Beijing on Wednesday by calling for it be denied access to artificial islands it is building in the strategic waterway. A Trump transition adviser told Reuters that Tillerson, Trumpâ€™s pick to be Americaâ€™s top diplomat, did not mean to suggest the new administration would impose a naval blockade, which would risk armed confrontation with China, something the new administration was not seeking. But another official authorized to speak on behalf of the transition team pushed back on that view, saying Tillerson â€œdid not misspeakâ€ when he said China should be barred from its islands. Amid the conflicting signals on policy, the team appears to be making progress on plans for a major naval in East Asia to counter Chinaâ€™s rise. The transition adviser told Reuters about specifics under consideration, such as basing a second aircraft carrier in the region, deploying more destroyers, attack submarines and missile defense batteries and expanding or adding new bases in Japan and Australia. They are also looking at installing â€œair force strike assetsâ€ in South Korea, bordering Chinaâ€™s neighbor North Korea, said the adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Trump, who succeeds President Barack Obama on Jan. 20, has vowed to greatly expand the U. S. Navy to 350 ships, but his transition team has not made clear how he will fund this, amid other massive spending plans. Chinaâ€™s Foreign Ministry said it could not guess what Tillerson meant by his remarks, which came after Trump questioned Washingtonâ€™s longstanding and highly sensitive â€ â€ policy over Taiwan. But an influential Chinese tabloid warned on Friday that blocking Chinese access to South China Sea islands would require the United States to â€wage war.â€ Trumpâ€™s pick for defense secretary, retired Marine General James Mattis, did not endorse Tillersonâ€™s message on the South China Sea, which would seem at odds with Washingtonâ€™s own longstanding commitment to freedom of navigation for all. Asked about the remarks at his confirmation hearing on Thursday, Mattis said Chinaâ€™s actions in the South China Sea were part of a broader attack on the world order, but said the State, Defense and Treasury Departments needed to put together an integrated policy â€so we are not dealing with an incomplete or an incoherent strategy.â€ The conflicting messages underscore the incoming administrationâ€™s struggle in crafting an approach to one of the biggest foreign policy challenges facing Trump, who during his election campaign repeatedly bashed China, saying it was â€killingâ€ and â€rapingâ€ America on trade. RISKS OF RETALIATION A former U. S. official who has informally advised Trumpâ€™s transition team said it may not have fully thought through the risks of any new U. S. military or trade pressure on China. â€We should not underestimate Chinaâ€™s willingness to retaliate in kind,â€ the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. As part of a drive to protect American jobs, Trump has threatened to declare China a currency manipulator even though economists say Beijing has been seeking to prop up, not weaken, its currency. He has also threatened to slap punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, risking a trade war that could hurt both countries and the global economy. Trump has yet to name to his national security team members with deep experience of the region, leading some analysts to question whether the new administration will have enough expertise to translate rhetoric on a more robust Asia policy into action. But Trump has appointed two harsh China critics to his trade team Peter Navarro, an academic who authored a book entitled â€Death by China,â€ and Robert Lighthizer, a former Reagan administration official. Trump advisers dismiss concerns their approach could prove risky or counterproductive, arguing that a â€peace through strengthâ€ stance will put real muscle behind U. S. policy in the region after decades of due to U. S. distractions elsewhere in the world. â€Once we start correcting the military imbalance, I actually think you will get more cooperation rather than less,â€ the Trump adviser said. Trump and his cabinet nominees have also vowed to step up pressure on China to rein in North Koreaâ€™s nuclear and missile programs, including by holding out the possibility of â€secondary sanctionsâ€ on Chinese entities found to be violating sanctions on Pyongyang. But analysts say China may be in no mood to cooperate if Washington is leaning on it on other issues. Those include U. S. pressure on Beijing to curb cyber hacking of U. S. entities. Chinaâ€™s official responses to recent broadsides have been measured so far as they wait to see how Trump will act once he takes office. â€We have seen many conflicting messages from people within his prospective administration,â€ said Tu Xinquan, a trade expert at Beijingâ€™s University of International Business and Economics. But analysts say confronting Beijing over nationalist issues like Taiwan and the South China Sea could trigger strong reactions, especially in a year when President Xi Jinping is seeking to further consolidate power at a congress of the ruling Communist Party held every five years. Zha Daojiong, a professor at Peking University, said the theme of clash of civilizations was becoming increasingly popular in Chinese circles and this was ominous. â€This does not bode well at all . .. And it means that the continued war drums from America on the South China Sea would not help matters at all.â€ (Reporting by Matt Spetalnick and David Brunnstrom",0

S. Justice Department investigation into ruptures of its air bag inflators linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide. The deal was announced hours after prosecutors in Detroit charged three former senior Takata executives with falsifying test results to conceal the inflator defect, which triggered the worldâ€™s biggest automotive safety recall. Takata will pay a $25 million fine, $125 million in a victim compensation fund, including for future incidents, and $850 million to compensate automakers for massive recall costs, the Justice Department said. The auto parts supplier will be required to make significant reforms and be on probation and under the oversight of an independent monitor for three years. The companyâ€™s shares rose 16. 5 percent in trading in Japan on news of the anticipated settlement, in which it agreed to plead guilty to a single felony count of wire fraud. The settlement, which must still be approved by a federal judge in Detroit, could help Takata win financial backing from an investor to potentially restructure and pay for massive liabilities from the worldâ€™s biggest automotive safety recall. â€Reaching this agreement is a major step toward resolving the airbag inflator issue and a key milestone in the ongoing process to secure investment in Takata,â€ Shigehisa Takada, chairman and chief executive of Takata, said in a statement. He added that the company â€deeply regrets the circumstances that have led to this situation and remains fully committed to being part of the solution.â€ Starting in 2000, Takata submitted false test reports to automakers to induce them to buy faulty air bag inflators, according to the Justice Department. Takata made more than $1 billion on the sale of the inflators and Takata executives fabricated test information about their performance, the department said in a statement. A federal grand jury separately indicted three longtime Takata executives, all Japanese citizens, after a more than U. S. criminal probe. Shinichi Tanaka, Hideo Nakajima, and Tsuneo Chikaraishi were indicted on wire fraud and conspiracy charges for allegedly convincing automakers while at the supplier to buy â€faulty, inferior, or dangerous inflatorsâ€ through false reports.â€ The Justice Department said the three were suspended in 2015 and not currently working for Takata. The indictment, unsealed on Friday, said they knew around 2000 that the inflators were not performing to automakers specifications and were failing during testing, but they provided false test reports to automakers. The inflators can explode with excessive force, launching metal shrapnel at passengers in cars and trucks. Many of those killed were involved in crashes that they otherwise may have survived. To date, 11 deaths and 184 injuries have been linked to the inflators in the United States. â€They falsified and manipulated data because they wanted to make profits on their air bags,â€ U. S. Attorney Barbara McQuade told a news conference in Detroit. McQuade, a â€soccer mom,â€ said Takata had knowingly exposed her to the risk that a minor car accident would â€send a metal projectile into my face.â€ Takata has 30 days to pay the $150 million for victim compensation and the criminal fine and then up to a year to pay the remaining $850 million, or within five days of securing a financial backer. Reuters reported in November that Takata may file for bankruptcy as part of a restructuring. In recent years, the Justice Department has had an unprecedented number of criminal investigations into wrongdoing by automakers and suppliers, reaching major settlements with Toyota Motor Corp ( ) Volkswagen AG ( ) General Motors Co ( ) among others. The Justice Department said it had recommended together with Takata that Ken Feinberg, a compensation expert, oversee the automaker and victim compensation funds. The recalls have affected 19 automakers to date. Regulators have said recalls would eventually affect about 42 million U. S. vehicles with nearly 70 million Takata air bag inflators, making it largest U. S. auto safety campaign ever. Regulators expect it will take at least another three years to begin all of the recalls",0
"498","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-sec-idUSKBN14X2CH?il=0","Sarah N. Lynch","The U. S. Supreme Court agreed on Friday to hear a case involving a New investment adviser that has the potential to limit the power of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission to recover illegal profits reaped by fraud or other wrongdoing. The court will hear an appeal filed by investment adviser Charles Kokesh, who the SEC sued in 2009 for allegedly misappropriating money from several company funds to pay for expenses such as salaries and bonuses. He is seeking to avoid paying $34. 9 million in disgorgement, a legal term for recovering profits made from illegal acts. The case hinges on whether the SEC has time limits on seeking disgorgement of gains, a remedy the regulator often uses to deter wrongdoing. The SEC currently faces a statute of limitations on collecting civil penalties, a time restriction the Supreme Court upheld unanimously in 2013. In that ruling, the justices found that the clock starts when a fraud occurs, not when it is discovered. But that window does not currently apply to disgorgement, which the SEC argues can be recovered at any time regardless of when the misconduct occurred. â€The purpose of the statute of limitations is to let people go on with some certainty in their business,â€ said Robert Anello, a partner at Morvillo Abramowitz Grand Iason & Anello PC, a white collar attorney who is following the case but is not involved in it. â€It is unfair to make people defend ancient conduct. Memories fade. Documents disappear.â€ An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment beyond the Solicitor Generalâ€™s filing on the agencyâ€™s behalf. After a jury found Kokesh liable for the violations alleged by the SEC, which occurred from 1995 through 2006, a federal judge ordered him to pay $2. 4 million in penalties, $34. 9 million in disgorgement and $18 million in prejudgment interest. While the penalties were limited to violations that occurred within the statute of limitations, the disgorgement covered conduct that largely exceeded that time frame. Kokesh appealed the judgeâ€™s ruling to the 10th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said disgorgement is not covered by the statute of limitations. Kokesh then appealed that decision to the Supreme Court. The 10th Circuit ruling conflicted with a prior ruling by the 11th U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a different case, which found that it is subject to the time limit. Attorneys for Kokesh said in court papers that government data shows the SEC has â€increasingly relied on disgorgementâ€ to maximize recoveries since the Supreme Courtâ€™s 2013 ruling. Daniel Nathan, a partner at Morvillo LLP who is also following the case, said the SEC was often arbitrary in the way it tries to divide up the pot of money it collects between disgorgement and penalties. â€Hopefully this decision will increase the rigor they bring to their sanctions,â€ he added.

Lawyers for the teenagers, who sued the federal government claiming it violated their constitutional rights by causing global warming, were scheduled to depose Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, in his capacity as a board member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group. The lawyers planned to ask Tillerson when he first learned of the impact the burning of fossil fuels was having on the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. His answers might then be used to prove the government, working with the energy and manufacturing industries, continued to allow activities harmful to the environment despite knowing the risks to future generations, said Julia Olson, a lawyer in Eugene, Oregon, who is executive director of Our Childrenâ€™s Trust and representing the teenagers. Tillersonâ€™s deposition was set for Jan. 19, a day before Donald Trumpâ€™s inauguration. But Olson said the APIâ€™s lawyers told her in a letter that Tillerson should not have to testify because he is no longer affiliated with the group. Her team has asked API to prove Tillerson had left the group on Dec. 28, when they sent notice of their intent to depose him. â€If he was still on the board on the date of notice of deposition, he can still be deposed,â€ Olson said. The lawsuit, brought in federal court in Oregon, says the U. S. government helped to cause climate change through its policies, thus denying a group of young people their constitutional right to life, liberty and property. The API and two other industry groups intervened in the case, claiming a judgment requiring the government to tighten environmental regulations would harm their business interests. Tillerson announced he was retiring from ExxonMobil on Dec. 14, a day after Trump announced his nomination as secretary of state. The API has not announced any change to Tillersonâ€™s role in its organization, but its president released a statement congratulating Tillerson on his nomination on Dec. 13.

The House voted 268 to 151, largely along party lines, for a waiver of a provision of a law on civilian control of the U. S. military that requires a wait after retirement before military can lead the Department of Defense. The waiver, which must still be signed by the president to become law, clears the way for Mattis to lead the Pentagon if he is confirmed, as expected, by the Senate. The Senate passed the waiver on Thursday by . A White House spokesman said on Friday that President Barack Obama would sign the measure if it came to his desk, rather than make it wait for Trump to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Most Democrats voted against the waiver, while Republicans supported it. One House member voted present. Mattis had been scheduled to testify before the House Armed Services Committee this week, but Trumpâ€™s transition team canceled his appearance. Democrats said they supported Mattis, but the cancellation set a dangerous precedent for Trump to sidestep Congress. Normally, lawmakers are able to question legislation in committee hearings before bills are brought up for votes in the full House. â€Before this president is even in office, at the very first opportunity, he is choosing to completely ignore us for no reason,â€ said Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the armed services panel. Democrats also said they worried that the waiver does not exempt Mattis from the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which retired officers are subject for life. In theory, he could be by Trump, as the commander in chief. Representative Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the committee, said he was also unhappy that the hearing had been canceled, but said the House had a responsibility to the country and the military to ensure that a Secretary of Defense is in place as soon as Trump becomes president.

"501","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-intelligence-analysis-idUSKBN14X2BZ","Warren Strobel and John Walcott","An unprecedented inauguration feud between Donald Trump and intelligence agencies that soon will be under his command could harm U. S. security if not quickly defused, current and former government officials said. They said morale at the CIA and other agencies was already sagging because of disputes with Trump over whether Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered interference in the U. S. election and over leaks about an unsubstantiated dossier compiled by a private security firm suggesting Moscow had compromising information on Trump. Unless addressed, the disputes could prompt the departure of personnel and lead those who remain to take fewer risks to counter security threats, the officials said. In the last few months, Trump has expressed his willingness to deal with Putin and denigrated the work of the intelligence agencies. This week, the accused agencies of leaking the dossierâ€™s information to the media, but Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said he did not believe intelligence officials were responsible for the leak. â€People shooting at (the CIA) is pretty common. But usually itâ€™s not the president,â€ one former senior U. S. official said. Trumpâ€™s transition team did not reply to email messages seeking comment. â€I think itâ€™s a recipe for disaster,â€ said Daniel Benjamin, who served in senior White House and State Department posts under Democratic presidents. Benjamin, now at Dartmouth College, said there was a â€strong chanceâ€ people would leave and they have â€tremendous valueâ€ to the private sector. Complicating the situation just a week before Republican Trump is sworn in, two of his nominees for top security posts set a different tone at their Senate confirmation hearings, heaping praise on the men and women who work in the secret world of intelligence gathering. Republican congressman Mike Pompeo, nominee for Central Intelligence Agency director, said on Thursday that he has seen CIA personnel â€walk through fire.â€ Separately, Trumpâ€™s nominee for U. S. defense secretary, James Mattis, told senators that he had a â€very, very high degree of confidenceâ€ in U. S. intelligence agencies. Mattis also put Russia at the top of a list of threats to U. S. interests. A top official at one intelligence agency said a growing number of intelligence officers over the age of 50 and with at least 20 years of service, including at least five years overseas, have drafted and in many cases signed but not dated their resignation letters. â€There is great anxiety here about the â€™s apparent disdain for the work we do and the dangers we face,â€ a second senior intelligence official, at another agency, said. He and others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters and morale at their agencies. RANCOR The latest round of rancor began with a CNN report that Trump had been briefed Jan. 6 by intelligence and law enforcement chiefs on a memo summarizing the unverified claims in the dossier. In blaming intelligence agencies for the leak, Trump wrote on Twitter: â€One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?â€ Spy chief Clapper called Trump before dinnertime on Wednesday to calm the waters. Trump and Clapper differed on what was said in the phone conversation. On Friday, Trump appeared to again blame U. S. spies for the leak. â€Probably released by â€™intelligenceâ€™ even knowing there is no proof and never will be,â€ he said on Twitter. U. S. intelligence agency personnel â€are kind of at being accused of being Nazis and intentionally leaking this stuff,â€ the former senior official said. The 17 U. S. intelligence agencies have combined budgets of more than $70 billion and tens of thousands of employees. They are responsible for everything from warning of terrorist attacks to supporting American troops on the battlefield and analyzing the impacts of global trends such as climate change. Several former U. S. officials said the tensions with Trump were the worst they could recall since President George W. Bush and the CIA traded blame in 2003 and 2004 over the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But Douglas Wise, a former senior CIA official, said it will be harder for Trump to â€beat upâ€ on his own intelligence chiefs once they are in place instead of officials appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama. â€I think things are going to change,â€ Wise said. Still, tensions seem likely to persist after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who will be Trumpâ€™s national security adviser, led the Pentagonâ€™s Defense Intelligence Agency until he was fired by Clapper. He has a suspicion of the CIA, according to Wise and others who have worked with him. â€What Pompeo said was somewhat reassuring, but itâ€™s not at all clear whether that matters, or whether Trumpâ€™s apparent attitude and Flynnâ€™s bitterness toward us is what counts,â€ the second senior intelligence official said.

S. presidential campaign began about the potential threat Russia poses to the country, according to a opinion poll released on Friday. The Jan. survey found that 82 percent of American adults, including 84 percent of Democrats and 82 percent of Republicans, described Russia as a general â€threatâ€ to the United States. Thatâ€™s up from 76 percent in March 2015 when the same questions were asked. The increased concern comes after a brutal election season during which Democrats and others raised questions about Donald Trumpâ€™s financial ties to Russia and the U. S. intelligence community accused Russia of engaging in cyber attacks during the election. Trump, who has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader and signaled during his campaign that he might take a softer line in dealing with Moscow, only recently accepted that Russia committed the hacks after receiving detailed briefings from intelligence officials. Trump initially criticized the findings, saying the culprit could be China or â€somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.â€ The poll asked people to rate Russia and a slew of other countries on a scale ranging from â€no threatâ€ to â€imminent threat.â€ It found that Americans were more likely to label Russia a threat than they were Iran, Syria, China, Saudi Arabia, Cuba or Yemen. Only North Korea ranked higher, with 86 percent of Americans labeling it as a threat. Some 25 percent of Americans gave Russia the highest concern, labeling it an â€imminent threat.â€ â€Russia is back to the old days of the Cold War,â€ said Oneita Wilkins, 69, a Republican who lives in a suburb of New Orleans, who rated Russia an â€imminent threat.â€ Wilkins did not vote in the election. She said she did not trust Trump or Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and chose to not vote for the first time in more than 40 years. The latest reports about Russian hacking lowered her opinion of Trump even further. â€Trump doesnâ€™t have any experience with other countries,â€ Wilkins said. â€I have a feeling that heâ€™ll be easily influenced by Putin.â€ Trump, earlier this week in his first news conference since the election, defended his goal of better ties with Putin, saying, â€If Putin likes Donald Trump, I consider that an asset, not a liability.â€ The poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It included 1, 169 American adults, including 490 Democrats and 475 Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire sample and 5 percentage points for Republicans and Democrats. (Reporting by Chris Kahn",0

Young","Chicago police routinely violated the civil rights of people in one of Americaâ€™s largest cities, the U. S. Justice Department said in a report released on Friday, citing excessive force, racially discriminatory conduct and a â€code of silenceâ€ to thwart investigations into police misconduct. The report said excessive force falls â€heaviest on black and Latino communities,â€ with police using force almost 10 times more often against blacks than whites. The Justice Department began a civil rights investigation in December 2015 after the release under court order of a video showing the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, by white officer Jason Van Dyke. The video was released more than a year after the shooting. The video sparked several days of protests and led to the ouster of Chicagoâ€™s police chief and calls for Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign. The McDonald shooting was one of many incidents that thrust Chicago and other U. S. cities into a national debate over the use of excessive by police against minorities. â€The Department of Justice has concluded that there is reasonable cause to believe that the Chicago Police Department engages in a pattern or practice of use of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution,â€ U. S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch told a news conference. The report said use of excessive force by Chicago police included officers shooting at fleeing suspects and using Tasers on children. Earlier this week Baltimore agreed with the Justice Department to change how officers use force and transport prisoners, almost two years after the death of a black man while in police custody. Chicago and federal officials have signed an agreement in principle to create a consent decree addressing the issues revealed by the probe. Chicagoâ€™s compliance with the decree would be reviewed by an independent monitor. The consent decree must be negotiated, then approved by a federal judge. Emanuelâ€™s decision to sign the agreement was reached too quickly, Chicago police union president Dean Angelo, Sr. said in a telephone interview. Angelo said that he had not read the entire report, but agreed with findings about a lack of training and equipment for officers. The Justice Department completed the review as confirmation hearings were underway for positions in Donald Trumpâ€™s administration, including his nominee for U. S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. â€We need to be sure that when we criticize law officers it is narrowly focused on the right basis of criticism,â€ Sessions said during Tuesdayâ€™s hearing. â€To smear whole departments places officers at greater risk, and we are seeing an increase in the murder of law officers up 10 percent last year. â€ President Barack Obamaâ€™s administration opened 25 civil rights investigations into law enforcement agencies as part of efforts to and improve police practices in the United States, particularly in minority communities. â€Some of the findings in the report are difficult to read,â€ Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said at the news conference. â€œQuite simply, as a department, we need to do better. â€ Many of the Chicago police departmentâ€™s problems stemmed from deficient training and accountability, Lynch said. Investigations into police misconduct were often thwarted by â€a code of silence among Chicago police officers . .. extending to lying and affirmative efforts to conceal evidence,â€ the report said. The report also found â€profoundly low moraleâ€ among many members of the department. Chicagoâ€™s mayor, Emanuel, enacted a number of police reforms over the past year, including a program and a new use of force policy, efforts that were recognized by Lynch.

Now it is pushing overseas to keep up that growth and absorb a bumper order of more than 200 planes: no easy task in a cutthroat southeast Asian market. The airline, which was set up in 2011, grabbed headlines with its flight attendants. It tapped a rich vein a economy and a young population that was starting to travel more. But VietJetâ€™s next step will be more challenging, industry analysts and executives say, as it expands further beyond Vietnam into choked southeast Asia, competitive China or Russia, where VietJetâ€™s fleet of narrowbody jets would confine it to the countryâ€™s east. Infrastructure in the region is clogged and new airport slots are rare. Even Kuala Lumpur, a less crowded airport, is highly competitive, thanks to airlines like Air Asia ( ). That has raised questions about VietJetâ€™s ability to absorb one of the regionâ€™s largest aircraft orders. â€(VietJet) have been extremely successful in the first five years but what they have done has been entirely domestic,â€ said analyst Brendan Sobie at consultancy CAPA. â€The domestic market will start to slow and it is more difficult to expand internationally â€” some people doubt that they can continue (growing) at the current rate.â€ According to CAPA, Vietnamâ€™s domestic aviation market grew 30 percent in 2016 to 28 million passengers nearly five times the growth rate of the broader economy. At VietJetâ€™s gleaming offices in Ho Chi Minh City, its chief executive and founder, Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao also Vietnamâ€™s first female billionaire outlines plans to push into China, Australia and Russia, where she studied and first worked. She dismisses concerns of excess competition, even in China, where local airlines have boomed. More than 10 Chinese carriers have begun flying since the aviation regulator relaxed a suspension on new airline licences in 2013. â€Other countries are still doing business with China and VietJet also has its own advantages,â€ she told Reuters. â€We can ally with Chinese airlines when wanting to expand in the countryâ€™s local market.â€ Unlike other new generation carriers in the region who have sought to set up alliances to gain clout without merging, VietJet has resisted. TOO MANY PLANES? Among the airlineâ€™s most imminent concerns will be its large aircraft order more than 200 planes, including more than 100 Airbus A320 family aircraft and 100 Boeing 737 Max 200s a mixed approach rarely taken by or new generation airlines, who prefer to streamline engineering needs. The Boeing order in particular, announced during a visit by U. S. President Barack Obama, prompted questions over whether the order was placed for political reasons. Thao dismissed this. Industry sources, however, say some of the 200 planes on order may be subject to reconfirmation or other clauses. Thao says the airline has support to finance its orders, worth over $20 billion, but has given no detail. The group has 5 trillion dong ($221 million) in debt. A Boeing spokesman said it had no change to its order. Airbus, which analysts say is most exposed to budget airlines in Southeast Asia including VietJet, declined to comment. VietJet ended 2016 with some 40 aircraft but is targeting more than 200 by 2023. And it is not without growth potential. Asia Pacific passenger growth is the fastest in the world. The carrierâ€™s profit almost doubled last year to over $100 million and it sees its bottomline rising by almost a third this year, thanks to a low cost base. An initial public offering to raise $170 million valued VietJet at $1. 2 billion. Shares start trading in February. â€So far, so good,â€ said analyst Shukor Yusof of Endau Analytics, describing growth so far as â€™a featâ€™. â€But Iâ€™m a bit skeptical if this rapid growth can be sustained without affecting the airlineâ€™s bottomline.â€ (Reporting by My Pham and Mai Nguyen in HANOI",0

Now a list has been produced of individuals whom the investigators have linked to a series of chlorine bomb attacks in including Assad, his younger brother Maher and other figures indicating the decision to use toxic weapons came from the very top, according to a source familiar with the inquiry. The Assads could not be reached for comment but a Syrian government official said accusations that government forces had used chemical weapons had â€no basis in truthâ€. The government has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the civil war, which is almost six years old, saying all the attacks highlighted by the inquiry were the work of rebels or the Islamic State militant group. The list, which has been seen by Reuters but has not been made public, was based on a combination of evidence compiled by the U. N. team in Syria and information from Western and regional intelligence agencies, according to the source, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. Reuters was unable to independently review the evidence or to verify it. The U. N. inquiry known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) is led by a panel of three independent experts, supported by a team of technical and administrative staff. It is mandated by the U. N. Security Council to identify individuals and organizations responsible for chemical attacks in Syria. Virginia Gamba, the head of the Joint Investigative Mechanism, denied any list of individual suspects had yet been compiled by the inquiry. â€There are no . .. identification of individuals being considered at this time,â€ she told Reuters by email. The use of chemical weapons is banned under international law and could constitute a war crime. (For graphic on chemical attacks in Syria, click ) While the inquiry has no judicial powers, any naming of suspects could lead to their prosecution. Syria is not a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC) but alleged war crimes could be referred to the court by the Security Council although splits among global powers over the war make this a distant prospect at present. â€The ICC is concerned about any country where crimes are reported to be committed,â€ a spokesman for the court said when asked for comment. â€Unless Syria accepts the ICC jurisdiction, the only way that (the) ICC would have jurisdiction over the situation would be through a referral by the Security Council.â€ The list seen by Reuters could form the basis for the inquiry teamâ€™s investigations this year, according to the source. It is unclear whether the United Nations or OPCW will publish the list separately. â€™HIGHEST LEVELSâ€™ The list identifies 15 people â€to be scrutinized in relation to use of CW (chemical weapons) by Syrian Arab Republic Armed Forces in 2014 and 2015â€. It does not specify what role they are suspected of playing, but lists their titles. It is split into three sections. The first, titled â€Inner Circle Presidentâ€ lists six people including Assad, his brother who commands the elite 4th Armoured Division, the defense minister and the head of military intelligence. The second section names the air force chief as well as four commanders of air force divisions. They include the heads of the 22nd Air Force Division and the 63rd Helicopter Brigade, units that the inquiry has previously said dropped chlorine bombs. The third part of the list â€Other relevant Senior Mil Personnelâ€ names two colonels and two . Hamish de an independent specialist in biological and chemical weapons who monitors Syria, told Reuters the list reflected the military chain of command. â€The decisions would be made at the highest levels initially and then delegated down. Hence the first use would need to be authorized by Assad,â€ said de a former commander of British and NATO chemical and biological defense divisions who frequently visits Syria for professional consultancy work. The Syrian defense ministry and air force could not be reached for comment. CHLORINE BARREL BOMBS Syria joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a U. S. deal that followed the deaths of hundreds of civilians in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. It was the deadliest use of chemicals in global warfare since the 1988 Halabja massacre at the end of the war, which killed at least 5, 000 people in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Syrian government, which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack, also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1, 300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. The United Nations and OPCW have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the agreement, which averted the threat of U. S. military intervention. The bodies appointed the panel of experts to conduct the inquiry, and its mandate runs until November. The panel published a report in October last year which said Syrian government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in and that Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015. The October report identified Syriaâ€™s 22nd Air Force Division and 63rd Helicopter Brigade as having dropped chlorine bombs and said people â€with effective control in the military units . .. must be held accountableâ€. The source familiar with the inquiry said the October report had clearly established the institutions responsible and that the next step was to go after the individuals. Washington on Thursday blacklisted 18 senior Syrian officials based on the U. N. inquiryâ€™s October report some of whom also appear on the list seen by but not Assad or his brother. The issue of chemical weapons use in Syria has become a deeply political one, and the U. N. inquiryâ€™s allegations of chlorine bomb attacks by government forces have split the U. N. Security Councilâ€™s members. The United States, Britain and France have called for sanctions against Syria, while Assadâ€™s ally Russia has said the evidence presented is insufficient to justify such measures. A Security Council resolution would be required to bring Assad and other senior Syrian officials before the International Criminal Court for any possible war crimes prosecution something Russia would likely block.

S. banks expressed optimism on Friday about the outlook for 2017 in their first public comments about quarterly earnings since the U. S. presidential election in November. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, the two largest U. S. banks, kicked off the corporate reporting season on a rosy note, each with healthy increases in profit. Those improvements came on the back of trading revenue gains, higher interest rates, healthy loan growth and cost controls. On the flip side, the earnings of Wells Fargo & Co, which also reported on Friday, were hurt by the fallout of a sales scandal and a loss related to accounting, both of which are particular to the San lender. Results at regional lender PNC Financial Services Group Inc were better than expected, with Chief Financial Officer Rob Reilly predicting the bank will be able to increase revenue faster than expenses this year. Shares of all four banks climbed Friday afternoon, with JPMorgan up 0. 5 percent at $86. 64, Bank of America up 0. 4 percent at $23. 01, Wells Fargo up 1. 1 percent at $55. 15 and PNC up 0. 4 percent at $118. 39. On conference calls with reporters and analysts, top executives were sanguine about topics ranging from interest rates and loan growth, to regulation and the incoming administration of Donald Trump. OPTIMISTIC â€We are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur growth,â€ Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. The bankâ€™s finance chief, Paul Donofrio, predicted BofA will be able to produce an additional $600 million in the current quarter from higher interest rates, with further gains throughout the year. He also cited customersâ€™ â€high credit qualityâ€ and positive trends in auto, home and loans, as being supportive of earnings. In the fourth quarter, BofA benefited from an aggressive program Moynihan detailed last summer, as well as a pickup in trading revenue. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was slightly more circumspect, but said he was comforted by the fact that Trump was selecting people with experience to join his team. Dimon also cited several positive economic trends that suggest the global economy is headed in the right direction, which will help buoy bank earnings. â€The economy is getting a little bit better,â€ he said. â€Interest rates help and looking forward, you probably have a better political, legal and regulatory environment.â€ The bank is sticking by its loan growth forecast of 10 to 15 percent for 2017, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it might be toward the lower end of the range. â€™SOLID PERFORMANCEâ€™ Despite Wells Fargoâ€™s unique troubles, its chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, also said the bank had a â€solid underlying performance,â€ citing loan growth, good credit quality and higher interest rates. The idea that banks will benefit from lighter regulation, rising interest rates and lower taxes under Trump has driven bank stocks up nearly 25 percent since the election. Nearly all the executives commented on the enthusiasm evident in markets, but were hesitant to fully endorse it. For instance, Dimon noted that it may take a full year for the new government in Washington to decide exactly how it will tackle complex issues like corporate tax reform. And, he said, increased competition means lenders may just â€compete awayâ€ any tax benefits they receive. â€Weâ€™ve all heard that the new administration in Washington supports tax reform, regulatory relief and other policies,â€ said PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak. â€But, so far, a move in interest rates is the only thing that has actually happened.â€ Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, will report results next week.

S. bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if U. S. Donald Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Wells Fargo & Co. ( ) JPMorgan Chase & Co ( ) and Bank of America ( ) kicked off the earnings season on a positive note on Friday, sending the S&P 500â€™s banking . SPXBK up as much as 2. 3 percent to its highest since February 2008 before paring gains. It closed trading up 0. 8 percent compared with a 0. 2 percent gain for the broader S&P 500 . The banksâ€™ top executives expressed optimism on Friday about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 8. The bank index rose 24. 8 percent between Nov. 8 and Dec. 9 then traded sideways for a month as bond yields fell. Investors were waiting for earnings and for concrete plans from Trump who has said he supports lower taxes, fiscal stimulus and lighter regulation, which would all help banks. Results and guidance from the big banks scheduled to report in the week ahead could boost the sector, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. â€Results are likely to be good and the outlook is going to be positive so thereâ€™s room for further gains,â€ said Praveen. The S&P banks index has traded recently at 13. 6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with its average multiple of about 11 but in line with the average of 13. 1, including the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. The banksâ€™ multiple is well below the broader S&P 500â€™s forward ratio of 17. But the banksâ€™ discount to the broader market has been shrinking since before the election. Praveen sees a bigger multiple expansion for the banking sector than for the S&P as a whole as more defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples that are sensitive to interest rate hikes will likely not enjoy as much expansion. Among banks reporting in the coming week Morgan Stanley ( ) is expected to post results Tuesday followed by Citibank ( ) on Wednesday. BB&T Corp ( ) KeyCorp ( ) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( ) all report on Thursday. Fred Cannon, director of research at KBW in New York, said banksâ€™ expanded valuations make them a â€ â€ story but as long as earnings estimates are rising they should stay popular. â€œUntil we see the blue skies get cloudy it will probably still be a sector in favor,â€ he said. Some investors are more cautious going into earnings. For instance traders in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( ) options have moved to protect gains. Open contracts on the fundâ€™s shares are now the most defensive in about four weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. â€The banksâ€™ stocks are likely to chop along in sideways volatility through earnings season,â€ said Jeff Morris, head of U. S. equities for Standard Life Investments in Boston, who doesnâ€™t see earnings as a big catalyst at a time when there is still uncertainty about whether Trump will be able to enact policies expected to help banks and accelerate economic growth. While his firm has increased the weighting of bank stocks in its $360 billion assets under management since the election it is â€not in the strong bull camp for bank stocks,â€ Morris said. He warned that bank stocks could come under pressure if there is no clear path toward regulatory relief or an acceleration of economic growth coming into the third quarter.

"510","http://www.reuters.com/article/us-venturecapital-bigdata-idUSKBN14X24C","Heather Somerville","Nearly every technology startup wants the same thing: more data. But in the rush to collect all manner of information about customers, tensions are rising in Silicon Valley over whether such practices amount to a form of surveillance that customers will ultimately find invasive. Whether ordering an Uber, streaming music, shopping online or tracking a health condition, consumers are giving an unprecedented amount of information to technology companies. â€The data that companies . .. have on you is significantly greater than you appreciate,â€ Mark Suster, managing partner at venture capital firm Upfront Ventures, said in an interview at a conference in Santa Barbara, California, sponsored by CB Insights, a business data firm. Discussions during the conference centered on the importance of â€™big data,â€™ the catchphrase referring to massive information sets that are stored and analyzed by companies. Collecting big data helps Airbnb, for instance, know whether its customers prefer to travel to the beach or mountains, and Uber knows popular locations and how to price trips. Collecting large amounts of data is also paramount to developing artificial intelligence (AI) among the most highly sought technologies in Silicon Valley, which teaches machines to make decisions that humans previously had. AI can, for example, help a shopper decide on a new pair of shoes, help a doctor diagnose a disease and enable a car to drive itself. But questions loom about how much personal information startups are collecting and how securely they store the data, with whom they share it and how they intend to use it. â€We are going to become comfortable with a level of surveillance that we never would have previously been comfortable with, because it makes things just a little easier,â€ said Jeremy Liew, a venture capitalist with Lightspeed Venture Partners. Some startups have overstepped. Uber Technologies Inc [UBER. UL] faced an investigation by New Yorkâ€™s attorney general into a feature known internally as â€God View,â€ which allowed employees to access and track the location of individual Uber riders without obtaining permission. Uber settled the matter and agreed to encrypt customersâ€™ data. Peter Coles, head economist for Airbnb, said the data his company guards is fairly benign. â€I think it is very unlikely that we would be collecting anything about users that they would be surprised to know.â€ But the tension was pronounced in one discussion at the conference. Matthew Zeiler, founder and chief executive of Clarifai, a visual recognition tool used in healthcare, suggested creating a database of anonymous patient data that was open to the public. â€That can be very harmful, especially to the patients,â€ argued Gabriel Otte, founder and CEO of Freenome, a startup. Patients would be loath to tell the truth, he said, if they knew their most private health information was going to end up on the internet, even without their name attached. Still, it is unclear if younger generations, who have grown up with apps such as Facebook and Snapchat that encourage sharing, view privacy in the same way. â€People donâ€™t care as much as they profess,â€ Dave McClure, founding partner of 500 Startups, said in an interview. â€Convenience is generally going to win over privacy.â€ (Reporting by Heather Somerville",0

S. civil rights activists vowed on Saturday to defend gains in voting rights and criminal justice during the presidency of Donald Trump, kicking off a week of protests ahead of the Republicanâ€™s inauguration. About 2, 000 mostly black protesters ignored steady rain to march and rally near Washingtonâ€™s Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, as speakers urged them to fight for minority rights and President Barack Obamaâ€™s signature healthcare law, which Trump has vowed to dismantle. The Rev. Al Sharpton, the rallyâ€™s organizer and a veteran civil rights leader, said Democrats in Congress needed to be sent a simple message: â€Get some backbone.â€ â€We march in the driving rain because we want the nation to understand that what has been fought for and gained, that youâ€™re going to need more than one election to turn it around,â€ he said. The rally drew fewer people than organizers had initially expected, but Sharpton said afterwards he was satisfied with the turnout, given the rain and temperatures hovering just above freezing. â€I really didnâ€™t think weâ€™d get those kind of numbers,â€ he said in a telephone interview. Trump, a New York real estate developer, won with a populist platform that included promises to build a wall along the Mexican border, restrict immigration from Muslim countries and dismantle Obamacare. His choice of Senator Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, to become attorney general has raised concern among many on the left that Trump could weaken voting rights for minorities and roll back criminal justice reforms. â€We will march until hell freezes over, and when it does, we will march on the ice,â€ said Cornell William Brooks, president and chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The rally also included the Hispanic group La Raza, politicians, relatives of slain by police, the National Urban League, Planned Parenthood and the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender civil rights. The rally came hours after Trump blasted U. S. Representative John Lewis after the Georgia Democrat and civil rights campaigner said Russiaâ€™s alleged hacking aimed at helping Trump put his legitimacy into question. Trump replied on Twitter that Lewis should focus instead on his Atlanta district. â€All talk, talk, talk no action or results! Sad! ,â€ he wrote. About 30 groups, almost all of them have gotten permits to protest before, during and after the inauguration. Thousands of demonstrators have vowed to shut down the inauguration. Washington police and the U. S. Secret Service plan to have some 3, 000 extra officers and an additional 5, 000 National Guard troops on hand for security. By far the biggest event will be the Womenâ€™s March on Washington the day after the inauguration, which organizers say could draw 200, 000 people. (Reporting by Ian Simpson",0
